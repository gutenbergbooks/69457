NOTE

PLAN 1: When the Graded Lessons were first issued the yearly courses were
grouped to correspond to this well-known classification of pupils, and
the text books were marked in accordance with this plan.

PLAN 2: The departmental grouping by a series of three years to a
department corresponds to the school grading where Junior High Schools
have been organized and is now recommended by many denominations.

Care must be taken to select the Graded Course by age and titles, as
indicated in the left column, rather than by department names.

OUT OF CHILDHOOD INTO YOUTH


Traits of Boyhood and Girlhood

At the beginning of the period of childhood for which the Junior Course
is intended, approximately nine years of age, there appears to be in
the life of the normal boy or girl a real transition as the traits and
interests of earlier years give way to those of full fledged boyhood and
girlhood. Strange premonitions of impending physical and mental changes
now appear, with suggestions of riper years that are rapidly approaching.
The physical and mental changes of this period are accompanied by an
awakening of social consciousness. This is noticeable in the friendships
formed, in the increase of love and sympathy for others and in the
dawning recognition of obligations toward others. The opposite of the
same tendency is reflected in the sense of rivalry and emulation and,
especially in boys, in the developing spirit of pugnacity, tempered with
a tendency to defend the weak. This growing social consciousness brings
with it also a stronger consciousness of self, a clearer recognition of
right and wrong and an awakening of conscience which now begins to take
the place of rules made by others as a guide to action.


The Inner Life of the Spirit

The normal growth of the inner life of the spirit is likewise rapid, the
spiritual awakening which may be counted on during this period bringing
with it the first religious crisis in the life of the boy and girl.
For this crisis the most careful preparation should be made. When the
spiritual awakening comes, the child should be given an opportunity to
choose for himself to live as God’s child in obedience to his laws and
in loving unselfish devotion and service for others. When the choice has
been made, the new sense of responsibility which follows must be fostered
and the child aided by suggestion and encouragement in daily conduct
to follow right habits of thought and action. The meaning, need and
the helpfulness of worship may be taught through actual participation
in services of worship suited to the pupil’s age and the manner of his
natural expression of religious impulses and aspirations.


Materials and Methods

The materials provided in the course of religious instruction for
this period take into account the growing interest of the pupil in
definite information and knowledge. This material includes stories
with a rich coloring of adventure and connected historical narratives
appealing to the interests of this age. By the use of these materials
the mind of the pupil is stored with the best Biblical images of strong
and noble character as his studies introduce him to the great heroes
and champions of the faith of past ages. Much emphasis is laid upon
religious privileges and duties, while profitable occupation exercises
are suggested to insure a daily reinforcement of the lesson taught in
the Sunday school hour. By precept and example the teacher may inculcate
habits of neatness, accuracy, punctuality, patience and other virtues. He
may watch over the religious life and as a wise specialist in the field
of soul nurture may anticipate and prepare the way for each successive
stage of that life’s unfolding.


This Text Book

The introductory chapters of this Teacher’s Text Book, entitled Our
Juniors, Their Teachers and Lesson Helps, present in detail the aims, the
methods and the underlying principles governing this Junior Course. A
careful study of this chapter together with the introductory chapters for
the other years of the course will be found most profitable.


The Course and the Writer

We would unreservedly commend the writer of this course, Josephine
L. Baldwin, to the confidence of all teachers. She writes, not from
theory alone, but from long, practical experience in teaching Junior
children. Every one of the lessons contained in this course she has
taught repeatedly. As a teacher of teachers, therefore, she speaks with
authority in the suggestions and directions contained in this Teacher’s
Text Book. The stories and suggestions regarding method in the form in
which they are here presented, are the rich fruitage of her expert
knowledge and training. There are no better courses for use with children
of junior age than this course. It is a tool well fashioned for its
intended use. As such it will not furnish a substitute for intelligent
study and devotion on the part of the teacher, nor will its use lessen
the dependence of the teacher on Divine help and inspiration in teaching;
but these personal qualifications being present, this Junior Course and
the graded system, of which it is a part, should yield large returns for
the Kingdom in the stimulation, growth, and enrichment of the religious
experience and life of children.

                                                               THE EDITOR.




OUR JUNIORS, THEIR TEACHERS AND LESSON HELPS


GRADED INSTRUCTION


Reasons for Having a Graded System

The reason for having a graded course of instruction for the Sunday
school is that the children differ year by year in knowledge, capacity,
interests, and needs. Graded lessons are simply an attempt to meet these
differences with instruction suited to each year of the developing life.
The aim of religious education is to fit the child for complete Christian
living, to make him not simply a religious individual but a useful
member of society, intelligently devoted to the highest welfare of his
fellows and of mankind. In order that this may be accomplished he must
have knowledge and his knowledge must lead to action. There is a broad
purpose underlying the graded lessons which is thus stated in terms of
the children’s religious needs.


The Purpose of the Graded Course

The purpose of the graded lessons is to meet the spiritual needs of the
pupil at each stage of his development. The spiritual needs, broadly
stated, are these:

1. To know God as he has revealed himself to us in his Word, in nature,
in the heart of man, and in Christ.

2. To exercise toward God the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord
and Saviour, trust, obedience, and worship.

3. To know and do our duty to others.

4. To know and do our duty to ourselves.


The Material Used

The material through which this purpose is to be attained is taken mainly
from the Bible and treated as story, biography, history, or literature
according to the period for which it is used. There are certain facts,
not found in the Bible, the knowledge of which is essential if the pupils
are to see God in the present day world. Therefore, many nature lessons
are given to the little children, incidents in the lives of modern
followers of the Lord are provided for the older children, and broader
studies from the field of modern reform and of missionary movements for
young men and women. There are also lessons on the Book itself and how it
has come to us. All of these lessons start outside of the Bible and lead
back into it for their explanation. The Bible lessons begin with the Word
and go out into life for their application. The one is just as biblical
as the other.


THE JUNIOR COURSE


Arrangement of Material

In the Graded System the Junior Course follows the two-years Beginners’
Course and the three-years Primary Course. In those earlier years the
stories are not chosen chronologically but are grouped under themes. The
sense of time dawns when the child is about nine years old, therefore the
Graded Lessons for the Juniors are arranged chronologically, at first by
periods and later in a straight chronological course from the Conquest of
Canaan to the end of New Testament History.


The Aims

The aim for the Junior lessons as a whole is:

=To help the child to become a doer of the Word, and to lead him into
conscious loyalty to Jesus Christ.=

The aims for each of the four years are these:

=1. To awaken an interest in the Bible, and love for it; to deepen the
impulse to choose and to do the right.=

=2. To present the ideal of moral heroism; to reveal the power and
majesty of Jesus Christ, and to show his followers going forth in his
strength to do his work.=

=3. To deepen the sense of responsibility for right choices; to show the
consequences of right and wrong choices; to strengthen love of the right
and hatred of the wrong.=

=4. To present Jesus as our Example and Saviour; to show that the
Christian life is a life of service; to deepen interest in the Book
which contains God message to the world.=

In the first year all but eight of the fifty-two lessons are the
elemental stories taken from the first five books of the Bible. This is
as it should be, for these stories appeal more strongly at this time
than at any later period. As the first twenty-six lessons are found in
the book of Genesis the stories are easy to find and the child is not
perplexed and confused by having to search for the one he wants among
many books with unfamiliar and difficult names. He is led by easy stages
in his Bible readings, and through the charm of the stories, together
with his growing ability to handle the book in which they are found, the
child not only becomes interested in the Bible but learns to love it.

The second part of the aim implies obedience, and that may be said to
be the key-word of this year’s work. (See the Junior motto and verse
for the year on the inside of front cover of the Work Book.) With these
children, it is largely the absolute obedience of the immature. This
form of obedience is a temporary virtue which must eventually be lost in
self-control. But no one can attain the most perfect self-mastery who has
not first learned to yield obedience to rightful authority. The transfer
of the seat of authority from without to within should keep pace with the
child’s growth in knowledge, in emotional balance and control, in moral
strength, and in the ability to form accurate judgments. The teacher’s
aim is to bring the child’s will into line with God’s will for him.


The Correlated Lesson

In the Junior period it is essential that two lessons be given every
week, the one the regular lesson in the Junior Graded Series and the
other a lesson dealing with the more mechanical part of the instruction.
This is called the Correlated Lesson because it is closely related to the
main lesson. The reason for having it is that during the Junior period
there is a large amount of information which must be given in order that
the pupils may grasp the truths in the lesson stories and learn how to
handle the Bible with ease.

In the first year the books and divisions of the Bible must be taught.
In the other years Bible geography becomes increasingly important as
a background for the lessons, and this is the time when it should be
studied; for the sense of location dawns at about the ninth year and the
interest in geography is at its highest during the Junior period. Some
knowledge of the manners and customs of Bible lands is necessary for
an understanding of many of the stories. All through the Junior period
are required frequent drills on essential facts and all material for
memorization in order that those things may be permanently held in memory.

A Junior child cannot profitably pay attention to one subject for more
than twenty minutes consecutively. The lesson story on any given Sunday
requires that much time, so it would be impossible to combine with it in
one Junior lesson period the necessary correlated information. Fifteen
minutes should be devoted to the Correlated Lesson, preferably the first
quarter of the Sunday-school hour, to be followed by the service of
worship and all the other exercises, leaving the last twenty minutes for
the lesson of the day.

In schools where this plan is followed and the lessons are well taught,
the memory texts are both learned and remembered. The children are
familiar with Bible lands and can associate events with the places
where they occurred. They understand the strange customs of Bible times
and therefore are not puzzled by accounts that would otherwise be
unintelligible. They know the Bible as a book and can find references
easily. The upper grade Juniors can find a score of the great passages
in the Bible without having the reference given. In schools where the
correlated lessons are not taught the children are not only ignorant of
many things they ought to know, but do not gain the benefit that they
should get from the course of study.


THE JUNIOR PERIOD


Beginning and End

Only broad and general statements can be made concerning the division
lines between the different departments of the Sunday school, especially
after the end of the Primary; but the largest factor in deciding when the
Junior period begins is the ability on the part of the pupils to read
well enough to be able to read in the Bible without too much stumbling.
The end of the period is indicated by the beginning of adolescence, and
this fixes the Junior period of the normal child as extending over at
least three years. The course provides studies for four years.


Characteristics

The general characteristics of the children in this period are marked,
differing in many important particulars from those of the period before
and still more sharply from those manifested in the adolescent years.
There is a reaching out for and a choice of companions differing from
the happy-go-lucky way in which the Primary child accepts his neighbors
as playmates and a growing tendency to concentration in groups or gangs
accompanied by the most intense loyalty to the members of the group.
The normal interests which have an important bearing are those in
reading, heroes, the forces of nature, and the attainment of results.
Intellectually, the child begins to seek for reality. The historic sense
develops, and the sense of location both develops and matures during this
period. There is a deep regard for authority if rightly administered by
one who the child feels has a right to rule over him. Memory is strong
and retentive. A deep-seated, though egoistic, sense of justice is
apparent. This is preeminently a time when habits are formed and fixed.

There are limitations here, as in every other period. The child is and
must be more or less self-centered, because this is a time when he must
pay attention to himself and get himself adjusted to the world about him
before he can send his energies out in service for others, as will be
normal in the next period. The reasoning power is very weak, depending
upon sequence rather than causality. The interest in people is altogether
in conduct and not at all in character; what a person does is what these
children care about, not what he is.


Spiritual Needs

The study of even these few characteristics so briefly stated makes it
evident that the children have special spiritual needs; that is, certain
phases of the great fundamental truths which underlie all religious
teaching will make the strongest appeal and be most helpful at this time.
For instance, in God’s relation to us, it is not the Fatherhood of God
which will appeal more strongly, but the Kingship of God, his authority,
his wisdom, his justice and power; but with this presentation of the
majesty of the Creator must be closely associated the thought of God as a
daily Companion, as a Saviour from the power of sin, and as the Giver of
eternal life and a heavenly home. Our relation to God as subjects of the
King, and as dependent upon him for guidance, is linked with the thought
of the privilege of cooperating with him in such forms of service as are
possible to children, and in such manifestations of love as find natural
expression in prayer, praise, and worship.

The Junior in his relation to others must be taught to play fair, to obey
those in authority, to cooperate heartily in the duties and joys of the
home life, and to champion right causes, whether standing alone or in
company with others. The duties the child owes to himself which can best
be taught and are most needed in this period are the formation of right
personal habits, making right choices, and establishing right conceptions
of progress.


THE JUNIOR TEACHER


Personality

A great deal is said about the characteristics of the Junior pupils and
how these affect the plans that are made for their instruction. They also
have a bearing upon the type of adult who should deal with the children
in this formative period. It should not be necessary to say that the
teacher must be a Christian and a church member, for consistency and
common sense alike would demand that he who seeks to prepare recruits
for the army of the Lord must be in active service himself. He cannot
say, “Go”; he must be able to say, as the Master did, “Come, follow me.”
The blind cannot be leaders of the blind. But there are many kinds of
Christians and church members-persons who differ in temperament and in
ways of looking at religious truth.

The Junior period is a time when the pupils are searching for realities.
If normal children, normally trained in the home and church, they have
almost unbounded credulity, which during this period rapidly develops
with growing knowledge and experience into true faith. This is the
God-given time for so strengthening the foundations of religious
belief for the children that in the succeeding periods, when doubts
will normally arise and sometimes beat most insistently upon the house
of their faith, it will stand firm because built upon a rock. It is
a crime to suggest doubts to Junior children or to surround them
with an atmosphere of uncertainty. The teacher who attempts to guide
children in this period should know what he believes, and believe it
with all his heart, and speak with no uncertain sound. This may seem
an almost impossible condition in an age when most learned scholars
find innumerable points of criticism upon which they cannot agree, and
concerning which many declare themselves to be agnostic; but there are
certain great fundamentals which all must believe if they are to be
intrusted with the leading of the young, and those who are chosen for
Junior teachers should have the temperament which puts emphasis upon the
positive and constructive in belief rather than upon the things which lie
on debatable ground.

A person who has not a keen sense of justice, and who is not able to
be impartial and to keep in the background any personal preferences
that he may have, should not attempt to teach Juniors. The children
will apply to themselves the most rigid rules if given an opportunity
for self-government, and will rejoice in obeying them, but they will
resent with the utmost intensity the slightest ruling of a teacher or
superintendent which has in it a taint of partiality or injustice. This
does not mean that the teacher of Juniors must be ideally perfect. The
impossible is not required of anyone in God’s work; but because “we teach
only a little by what we say, much more by what we do, and most of all
by what we are,” it is more important that the Junior teacher should
cultivate those qualities in himself which appeal most strongly to the
Junior child than it is that the lessons chosen for the children shall
present those qualities through the lives of the heroes of the past.

The best teacher is one in whom the pupil feels the presence of religion
as a concrete, natural thing. The best Sunday-school teaching is an
initiation of the pupil into sacred things, and initiation is a process
of admitting one to a society of persons and fellowship. Many persons
have been asked to say what in their experience as Sunday-school pupils
most influenced them for good. The reply, apparently the invariable
reply, has been, “The personality of the teacher rather than the content
of formal instruction.” Nothing in the way of methods or advice can take
the place of wholesome, winning personality that actually lives in the
realities of the Christian experience and truly admits pupils into the
fellowship of this life.[1]


Opportunity

It is the aim of the Sunday school “gradually to bring to completeness
or perfection the worthy qualities and characteristics of each pupil,
and repress the unworthy, to the end that he may do the work and exert
the influence of a true Christian in his environment.” The Junior period
is a time when the Sunday-school teacher is given a unique opportunity
for helping to realize this aim. In the child’s physical life this is a
time of slow growth and bodily vigor, which makes possible a degree of
concentration in work and study not to be expected in the earlier years.
It is a time when the memory is both strong and retentive, and the child
may make the greatest treasures of holy writ his own for all time if he
learns them in these years.

The brain cells are still plastic, though hardening rapidly. It is
therefore easy to get the child to act along suggested lines, and through
incentives and rewards to secure that regular, voluntary repetition
of the right act which is necessary for the formation of a habit. The
fact that this is the great habit forming and fixing period of life
makes evident at once the large opportunity and the corresponding
responsibility of the Sunday school in its relation to Junior children.

Teachers, while endeavoring to exemplify the virtues which they
inculcate, should constantly aim to help their pupils to form such habits
as regular Bible reading and study, church attendance and attention
(which is even more important), punctuality, cooperation, industry,
thoroughness, perseverance; cheerful, systematic, intelligent giving,
reverence and orderliness. It is tremendously important that the children
shall form character building habits at this time; for “whatever is found
in the life as habits of thought, feeling, and action at the dawn of
adolescence will then be greatly magnified and strengthened.”

Another fact which emphasizes the opportunity this period presents is
that at some time during these years, usually toward the end of the
period, comes the first great age of spiritual awakening, when the child
may be expected to become conscious of his relationship to Christ, and
proclaim his newly realized loyalty. In the eyes of the church the child
is a member of the kingdom of heaven. It now becomes the duty of the
church “to see that the child does not lose his spiritual inheritance;
that he is kept in the kingdom and so trained that at the time when he
becomes fully conscious of his relationship to the Divine, he will choose
to claim his inheritance as a child of God and lead the life for which it
calls.”

It is sometimes said that Junior children are “trying,” and this is
absolutely true. Each class tries its teacher, not because the children
wish to be aggravating, but because it is ordained that they shall gain
their knowledge and experience by testing each new situation in which
they find themselves, and each new person with whom they are brought
into close contact. What they are seeking is reality, and they will
experiment until they find out what is true about their teacher. They
are not endeavoring to get their own way, though that may often seem
to be the case. They never like a teacher who is weak and vacillating,
but if in the testing process they discover a teacher who knows what he
tries to teach, who is firm and kind, impartial, just, and loving, they
will yield to that teacher the truest respect, admiration, loyalty, and
affection. The Junior teacher should rejoice in the opportunity that his
task affords. There is no other time in the life of a Sunday-school pupil
when such a ready response will be made to the right influence, example,
and instruction.


GUIDES FOR STUDY AND TEACHING


The Teacher’s Text Book

Two text books are provided with the lessons—one for the teacher and one
for the pupil.

In the teacher’s book it has been the aim to give as much material for
the individual study of the lesson as is possible within the prescribed
limits of the book. Bible passages that throw light either upon the
truth to be taught or upon the meaning of the lesson story have been
carefully selected. The quotations from the commentators will also be
found valuable. The plan of study that will bring the best results to any
teacher using this book is first to read carefully the lesson passage
and any history intervening between the lesson and the preceding one, to
study what is said by the commentators and the Bible references that are
given, and to glance over the suggestions under Lesson Preparation.

When these things have been done the teacher should turn away from
all books and ask himself, “How can I best present this lesson to my
class?” and with the needs of his own pupils in mind, plan the lesson
for presentation. After the plan is settled the method of presentation
as given in this book will not prescribe a method but may be helpful in
the way of suggestion. The importance of individual preparation cannot be
emphasized too strongly, for no ready-made lesson can be perfectly fitted
to any class.

The lessons for the first half of the quarter are taken from the “morning
stories” in the first eleven chapters of Genesis. These stories nourish
the soul of the child as few other stories can, because they keep the
child in the presence of God. It is a God who not only creates, but
guides, loves, reproves, walks, and talks with man as one friend with
another. The nine-year-old child is hardly yet beyond the stage where the
fancies of fairy tale and myth make a strong appeal. For that reason it
seems to him perfectly natural that God in visible presence should meet
and converse with his children. These stories, therefore, strengthen the
God-consciousness within him, and awaken a response which results in the
realization that he, too, may have personal relation with his loving,
heavenly Father.

“The ancient Hebrew had no notion of science. He did not ask for the
immediate cause of physical events. It entirely satisfied his instinct
for ultimate truth to assume that thunder was God’s voice; that God had
planted those cedars whose life reached back before the memory of man. He
related all mysteries to God, and in that relationship his mind rested
and his heart was satisfied.”[2]

This is equally true of the child. His heart is satisfied with God, and
he is not troubled with any questions concerning whether these early
stories relate actual happenings or not. They are gloriously true because
they tell the truth about God. They give the child an axis for his
universe, and that is what he is seeking. The teacher should not try to
interpret the stories, but simply tell them as nearly as possible in the
splendid simplicity of the Bible language.


The Pupil’s Book for Work and Study

This book guides the pupil in his Bible reading and study, indicates
verses or passages for memorization, and through the handwork furnishes
him an opportunity for making the lesson his own. There are several
reasons why this book is of high educational value. One is that it serves
to fix the facts clearly in mind and facts are the basis of ideas. Ideas
cannot be clearly seen until the facts are mastered.

But the book does much more for the pupil than to put him in the
possession of knowledge. It gives him an opportunity to practice
obedience in a different way from anything to which he has been
previously accustomed. In the Primary Department the children do an
increasing amount of handwork, but they do it with the help and under the
supervision of their teachers. The nine-year-old child must learn to work
by himself and to obey printed instructions.

Teachers examining this work for the first time may think that the
pupils’ books for the first year are so stereotyped as to leave no
room for originality. That is true in a sense, and the work has been
prepared purposely in this way, for before the pupils can do original
work, they must have a certain basis of knowledge. They must learn how
to follow printed instructions carefully, and be able to make themselves
do the thing they are told to do at the time they are told to do it.
If through the books of the first year the pupils should learn to be
both accurate and punctual, we might feel well repaid even if no other
results come from this study. But the fact is that while doing the work
exactly as it is assigned they will get the greatest benefit from the
lesson themselves, for the spirit of obedience generates an atmosphere in
which all the Christian graces possible to a child can best develop and
flourish.

The work book ministers to the child’s growing sense of responsibility.
If he accepts the responsibility and honestly tries to meet its
requirements his character is strengthened thereby. If he shirks his duty
his moral nature is weakened.

No teacher can afford to allow the children to neglect the work book. If
they do not do the work there outlined, they cannot learn the lessons, no
matter how well the stories may be told in class. The child learns not
by hearing but by doing. On the other hand the book must never be thought
of as an end in itself, but only as a means to an end. In one school
the most perfect work book shown in the exhibit represented the most
abject failure from the standpoint of religious education. It was made
by a boy whose mother had compelled him to do the work and supervised it
rigidly. He hated it with his whole heart because he was never permitted
to play until that work was done. The mother was exceedingly proud of
the book. To have it completed and neatly done was the end she had been
seeking, and that she had attained. But the book was well-nigh worthless
in the teacher’s estimation because it did not represent the child’s
own initiative and volition. When the pupil, incited by example and
suggestion and rewarded by commendation, chooses to do the work, the book
becomes one of the important means by which the great end of character
building is accomplished for him.

The teacher should always have a copy of the Pupil’s Book for Work and
Study and do the work in it just as he would like to have the children do
it. Of course it should be better done than any child can possibly do it.
If the teacher colors the pictures with water colors, uses illuminated
initial letters, and writes neatly and plainly, his book will be a great
incentive to the children to do the very best possible work themselves.

In the beginning of the first quarter’s work the teacher should remember
that these children are still to all intents and purposes Primary
children unaccustomed to working alone. It is exceedingly important that
each teacher should meet the children of the class during the week after
teaching the first lesson and show them how to cut out the pictures for
that first lesson and paste them in the book. The children would then be
certain to start right, and though it may not be true that “well begun
is half done,” a good beginning is so encouraging to the child that he
is much more likely to keep up the work and to find it enjoyable. But
if he makes mistakes or neglects to do the work at the beginning it is
doubly difficult to interest him later. The week day gathering to start
the children on their handwork might be called a Work Book Social, ending
with games and light refreshments. When the children arrive have them
take their books and read carefully with you the instructions on pages 2
and 3 before doing the pasting and writing for Lesson 1. Suggest that
the picture sheet be handled very carefully so that the pictures needed
for later use may not become marred or defaced in any way. Encourage the
children to keep the book clean and neat. In order that the cover may not
be soiled from use, it is well to make a cover for each book from manilla
paper and place the picture sheet between the manilla cover and the cover
of the book so that there will be no danger that the pictures will be
lost as the book is carried home. Explain that the reading is to be done
each day just as indicated in the book. Great stress should be put at
all times upon the doing of these specified tasks regularly and keeping
strictly up to date with them, in order that the children may form the
habit of daily Bible reading and study.

Incentives and rewards will be found necessary as means for inducing the
children to choose to do the work. Juniors do not love work, but are
interested in the attainment of results, and when wisely led will learn
later to love work for work’s sake. Among the incentives there should be
a department Honor Roll, and a Class Banner. The first year children who
complete their books satisfactorily should be given a social or outing at
the end of each quarter. They like public recognition of every kind, so
the prospect of having the book appear in the exhibit on promotion day is
a strong inducement for doing good work.

Because of the necessary wear and tear on the book and the danger that it
may be lost in carrying back and forth, it is not best to have the pupils
bring their books every week to the school all through the year; but in
the beginning it is desirable to have the book brought each week so that
the teacher may see how the work is being done. After the children are
well started the teacher can use his own book in the class in giving any
necessary instruction.


The Children’s Bible

In the beginning of this Junior work every pupil must have a Bible of
his own, the American Standard, if possible. If the parents will not or
cannot provide one, the school must do so, for the child cannot possibly
do the work as outlined unless he has a Bible to work with. It is also
essential for other reasons. No one can be interested in a book which
he does not know how to handle, and it is impossible for any child to
become familiar with the Bible if the only time he uses it is on Sunday
during the Sunday school session.

If some of the children have a King James Version and some the American
Standard, explain that both are translations into English from another
language, that the King James translation was made three hundred years
ago and that of the American Bible finished at the beginning of this
century. Tell the children also that because we think the American
Standard gives the meaning more clearly we use it in these lessons
whenever any memory texts are printed.


The Rainbow Bookmark

There is no question but that learning the books and divisions of the
Bible is one of the hardest tasks that the children will meet during
the Junior period. Most of the books have names that are in a foreign
language and therefore especially difficult to learn. But as the children
commit anything to memory easily in this period, and as the interest in
new words is strong, the work is not nearly so hard as adults are apt
to think it. But whatever the difficulty may be it is essential, if the
children are to get the best results from the Junior work, that in this
first year they shall learn the names of the books of the Bible, and
learn how to handle the Bible and find references quickly.

The use of the rainbow bookmark has been found helpful in interesting the
children in the study and making it easier for them, and in awakening in
them a desire to use their own Bibles. Its bright colors are attractive,
and the rainbow standing for God’s promises has a beautiful meaning,
which is joyfully recognized by the children when they hear the story of
The Flood. The bookmark is also useful in conducting department or class
drills.

This bookmark is made of nine ribbons in the prismatic colors with indigo
and purple, darker shades of blue and violet, and a white ribbon to mark
the Gospels. The colors are used in this order: red, orange, yellow,
green, blue (light), white, indigo, violet, and purple. The ribbons put
together in such a way that they will not tear the leaves of the Bible
can be secured of the publishing house at 25 cents for each bookmark.


How the Bookmark Is Used

The bookmark is placed in the Bible by putting the ribbon at the end of
the division for which it stands. In this way red follows Deuteronomy,
and marks the five books of Law or the Pentateuch. Orange, following
Esther, marks the twelve books of History. Yellow, following the Song of
Solomon, marks the five books of Poetry. Green, following Daniel, marks
the five books of the Major Prophets. Blue, following Malachi, marks the
twelve books of the Minor Prophets. White, following Saint John, marks
the four Gospels. Indigo, following Acts, marks the one historical book
of the New Testament. Violet, following Hebrews, marks the fourteen
Pauline Letters. Purple, following Jude, marks the other seven letters.
Revelation, the one book of Prophecy in the New Testament, has no ribbon.

There is a peculiar fitness in having white, the combination of all
the colors, for the Gospel story, which is the center and climax of
all the Bible narratives, and it is very desirable to have the life of
Christ marked in a peculiar way which will set it apart from the rest
and emphasize its importance. In the regular order indigo, the darkest
and least attractive of all the ribbons, would mark the Gospels, and
there would be but one ribbon for the letters, which leaves a series of
twenty-one names to be learned in one group.


The Bookmark as a Reward

This device is first mentioned in connection with Lesson 8. In the
correlated work for Lesson 9 slips of paper of the bookmark colors are
suggested as markers for the memory texts, and the children in this way
begin to learn the kinds of books in the Bible. A sheet of paper for each
color is not difficult to secure and would make enough strips for several
classes.

If the school can afford to give them, the bookmarks make a fine reward
to give to the children when they have learned the books and divisions
perfectly. If the parents can afford to buy them and the school cannot,
suggest that they do so but ask them to wait until the children know the
names of the books, so that it will come as a reward in any case.


PROMOTION REQUIREMENTS AND HONORS


The Basis for Promotion

In any graded course of study the pupils are expected to earn promotion
from grade to grade by attaining a certain required average in their
work. In the Junior Course the Pupil’s Book for Work and Study is, as
the name implies, both a guide in study, and a means of fixing in mind
the knowledge which has been gained. To meet the requirements of this
book the pupil must do the daily Bible readings, learn the memory text
or texts each week, do whatever reading is required, and learn the hymns
that are printed in the book. At the beginning of the course the pupils
should understand that the doing of the work for which the Work Book
calls is a requirement for promotion. In all schools seventy-five per
cent out of a possible one hundred is accepted as a passing average.
Therefore, three out of four Work Books satisfactorily completed during
the year entitle the child to promotion. Knowledge that the requirements
of the Work Book must be met in order to earn promotion is with many
children one of the strongest incentives that can be presented to them
for doing that work regularly and well.


Recognition for Extra Work

Every child should be incited to do more than merely meet the requirement
that passes him from one grade to the next. It is to furnish this
stimulation that extra honor work is provided. If the child chooses to
complete the fourth Work Book he earns an honor in that way. If the hymn
given for illustration is illustrated that gives another honor. Learning
the optional memory passages, prayers, and hymns is a third method of
gaining honors; and regular attendance upon the church service a fourth.

At the beginning of this lesson the teacher and each pupil should have
his Bible in hand.

Let us look at this book of ours which is the finest story book in all
the world. What name do you find on the back of the book? The word Bible
means “The Book,” and that is the best possible name for God’s Word,
because it is the Book of all the world, the one of which more copies
are made, sold, and read than of any other. In the last hundred years
316,000,000 copies of the Bible were sent out by the different Bible
societies of the world.

Now let us look at this wonderful Book. Turn to the title-page and we
will read together what we find there. Containing what? So there are two
great divisions in this book of ours, one called the Old Testament and
the other the New Testament, and it is just as you would think from the
names. The Old Testament tells of things that happened long, long before
those that are told about in the New Testament. (Drill on the names of
the two parts of the Bible until the class is familiar with the words.)

Now let us look at the page opposite the first book of the Old Testament.
What do you find there? (The Names and Order of the Books of the Old
Testament.) So you see our Bible, the great Book of the world, is not
simply one book but a whole library of books. How many books are there
in the Old Testament? (If there is time it might be well to let each one
count for himself.) So the Old Testament has 39 books.

(Follow the same plan with reference to the New Testament, and when the
pupils have found that there are 27 books have them find the number of
books in the Bible by adding the two numbers. When you have drilled on
these figures and facts sufficiently give to each pupil a copy of the
Pupil’s Book for Work and Study and show them the first part of Lesson 1,
letting them tell what words are to be written in the spaces as the work
for the following day at home. Do not let them look ahead at the other
lesson, as that is to be taken up after the lesson has been taught.)

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

What, then, are the truths taught us in these chapters? The first is
that there has been a creation, that things now existing have not just
grown of themselves, but have been called into being by a presiding
intelligence and an originating will. No attempt to account for the
existence of the world in any other way has been successful. A great deal
has in this generation been added to our knowledge of the efficiency of
material causes to produce what we see around us; but when we ask what
gives harmony to these material causes, and what guides them to the
production of certain ends, and what originally produced them, the answer
must still be, not matter but intelligence and purpose.—_The Expositor’s
Bible_, _Genesis_, _Marcus Dods_.

The record is not a geological treatise, but a hymn of praise to God,
magnifying his mighty works, indicating man’s high relation to him, and
hallowing the weekly Sabbath, which is man’s day of rest.—_The Handy
Commentator_, _A. R. Payne Smith, Dean of Canterbury_.

The cosmogony of Genesis shows, in opposition to the conceptions widely
prevalent in antiquity, that the world was not self-originated; that it
was called into existence, and brought gradually into its present state,
at the will of a spiritual Being, prior to it, independent of it, and
deliberately planning every stage of its progress. The spirituality, not
less than the dignity, of the entire representation is indeed in marked
contrast to the self-contradictory, grotesque speculations of which the
ancient cosmogonies usually consist. “It sets God above the great complex
world process, and yet closely linked with it, as a personal intelligence
and will that rules, victoriously and without a rival.”—_The Book of
Genesis_, _S. R. Driver_.

If anyone is in search of accurate information regarding the age of this
earth, or its relation to the sun, moon, or stars, or regarding the exact
order in which plants and animals have appeared upon it, he should go to
recent textbooks in astronomy, geology, and paleontology. It is not the
purpose of the writers of Scripture to impart physical instruction, or
to enlarge the bounds of scientific knowledge. So far as the scientific
or historical information imparted in these chapters is concerned, it
is of little more value than the similar stories of other nations. And
yet the student of these chapters can see a striking contrast between
them and extrabiblical stories describing the same unknown ages handed
down from prescientific centuries. Here comes to view the uniqueness
of the Bible. The other traditions are of interest only as relics of
a bygone past. Not so the biblical statements; they are and ever will
be of inestimable value, not because of their scientific teaching, but
because of the presence of sublime religious truth in the crude forms of
primitive science. If anyone wishes to know what connection the world
has with God, if he seeks to trace back all that now is to the very
fountain-head of life, if he desires to discover some unifying principle,
some illuminating purpose in the history of the earth, he may turn to
these chapters as his safest and, indeed, only guide to the information
he seeks.—_The Christian View of the Old Testament_, _Frederick Carl
Eiselen_.


AIM

=To present the thought of God as the Creator of all things, the rightful
ruler of the universe, and to establish in the child an attitude of
reverence toward God as Creator, and toward nature as his work.=


LESSON PREPARATION

The best possible preparation for the teaching of this lesson and
the accomplishment of its aim is to saturate one’s mind with the
God-permeated story of the creation in the lesson passage, and other
Bible passages given, in which God stands preeminent as the almighty
Creator of the universe.

In the Intermediate period, the four years that follow the Junior, it
would be highly interesting, and instructive as well, to discuss with
the class the various creation stories that are found in the writings of
antiquity, and to compare them with the story as given in Genesis; but
these children have not the historical background that would be necessary
to enable them to appreciate such discussions. What they are most
intensely interested in is the deeds of people. Not what people think or
what they are, but what they do, attracts the Junior child; and in like
manner it is not the attributes of the Deity, but his power manifested
in the universe, creating, ruling, and overruling, that will hold the
attention and minister to the spiritual needs of those we teach.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Point of Contact

(Show a picture representing a person or persons in the act of prayer.
The well-known Angelus is perhaps one of the best for this purpose.
Question on it, and get from the children, if possible, the story of the
call to prayer.)

The sweet sound of the bell borne on the evening breeze from the steeple
of the village church comes to the field where the workers are busy with
their tasks. What do they do as they hear it? To whom are they speaking
when they bow their heads?

Let us think for a moment of another scene. It is in another country far
away from this, and the people look very different from those in our
picture, but they too are bowing, not simply the head but the whole body,
for they are kneeling and their heads are bowed to the earth. What do
you think they are doing? Yes, they are praying, but to what? As we look
toward the east we see that the sun is just rising above the horizon,
and it is the sun that those people are worshiping. In that country and
in others we could find people who worship the moon in the same way, and
the reason why these things are done is that all people everywhere have
a desire in their hearts to worship, and these people have taken the
things that they see which seem to them to be the most wonderful and have
made gods out of them. They know nothing about this greatest Book in all
the world, which you and I know and love, and so they do not know of the
great and good God to whom you and I pray, and whom we call our Father.

If we could see those people and talk with them what would we wish to
tell them? It seems to me that for these people, the first story to tell
from God’s Word would be the first story in that Book, one that we have
heard, perhaps, many times, but which we never tire of hearing, and which
we are to hear once more to-day.


The Lesson Story

It seems strange, does it not? to think of a time when there was no
earth; but there was such a time and there our story for to-day begins.
All was black darkness where this world now is, but God was in his
heaven, for in his Word we read, “Before the mountains were brought
forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from
everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” So in the eternity of long,
long ago God lived and ruled, and he was thinking of a people whom he
would make in his own image to be his children, and of the home that
he would make for them. Then it was that from the great black space of
the universe darkness fell away, for God said, “Let there be light:
and there was light. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
called Night.” Under the almighty hand of the Creator, at his command,
this planet that we call the earth began to swing in its orbit, but it
was wrapped in vapors until God spoke again saying, “Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
the waters.” At his words the clouds gathered together above, separating
themselves from the waters upon the earth, “and God called the firmament
Heaven.” (From this point try reading the story from the Bible, but have
it so thoroughly in mind that if you find the attention of the pupils
wavering in any degree you can return to the other method. Whether you
read or tell the story of the six days, have the pupils open their Bibles
and read with you the first three verses of the second chapter.)

“In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the
sabbath day, and hallowed it” (Exodus 20:11).

What a beautiful story it is, and how glad we are to know that all the
wonders of the earth and sky and sea are the handiwork of our Father!
“The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his
handiwork” (Psalm 19:1).

  The unwearied sun, from day to day,
  Does his Creator’s power display,
  And publishes to every land
  The work of an almighty hand.
  Soon as the evening shades prevail,
  The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
  And nightly, to the listening earth,
  Repeats the story of her birth;
  While all the stars that round her burn,
  And all the planets in their turn,
  Confirm the tidings as they roll,
  And spread the truth from pole to pole.

This is what the poet has said about the moon, sun, and stars in the
heavens, and then he says that though there is no voice or sound that we
can hear, still they truly sing and always of God their Creator. This is
the way that the poet has told the story to us:

  What though in solemn silence all
  Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
  What though no real voice nor sound
  Amid the radiant orbs be found?
  In reason’s ear they all rejoice,
  And utter forth a glorious voice;
  Forever singing as they shine,
  “The hand that made us is divine.”

                  —_Joseph Addison._

The most wonderful thing of it all is that though our God is so great
he tells us in his Word that we may speak to him in prayer. That is the
meaning of the Angelus bell calling to prayer every day, and it is the
meaning of other bells which on one day in the week ring sweet and clear,
not as a call to prayer in the midst of work or play, but as a call to
worship on the day that is holy, set apart from the duties of the week,
and made a day of loving service and praise to our God.


THE PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

If you have not already done so, read carefully the comments and
suggestions on page 22, concerning the necessity for helping the children
to start the work in their books correctly. Read what is said on page 26
about promotion requirements and let your pupils know at the beginning of
their work how important it is for them to do regularly what is asked of
them in the Work Book if they wish to earn an honorable promotion at the
end of the year.




LESSON 2

THE CORRELATED LESSON


(Holding your Bible, review something in this way:)

What is this book called? What does the word Bible mean? Into how many
parts is the book divided? What are they called? Why is the first called
the Old Testament and the second the New? How many books are there in the
Old and how many in the New? How many in the Bible? What is the name of
the first book in the Bible? Who can spell that word? What does it mean?
What is the first verse in the first book?

(Open your Book for Work and Study that the pupils may see your first
lesson neatly written and the pictures pasted. Even though you have had
the children together during the week as suggested on page 22, in order
that you might help them work out this first lesson in their books, it
will be an encouragement to them if you examine each book and commend
the work heartily when it is possible to do so. If any have not yet done
the work it is of the utmost importance that you have them stay after
Sunday school or see them either at their homes or your house before
next Sunday. To allow the first week’s work to be neglected will leave
the child to conclude that it is not very important after all and that
you do not really care whether it is done or not. As soon as possible
the children must learn to do the work without assistance, but at the
beginning they will need both help and stimulation. Speak of the fact
that if they do all the work in the Junior Course and keep their books,
they will have a little library of twenty-three books illustrated with
many beautiful pictures. Tell them of the exhibit of Work Books when
the work of all the Juniors will be shown to other people in the Sunday
school and to the parents and friends of the children. Whatever you can
do to make the child see the value in his book and arouse his pride in
his work will be a great help to him in establishing habits that make
for strength of character. To allow a pupil to fail to do his work is to
encourage a neglect of duty and indifference to just obligations, which
will inevitably weaken his moral fiber.)




LESSON 2

The Garden of Eden


=Teaching Material.=—Genesis 2:4-25.

=Pupil’s Reading.=—Genesis 2:9, 15-25.

=Memory Text.=—And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden
of Eden to dress it and to keep it. Genesis 2:15.


LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Proverbs 14:23; 18:9; 22:29. Ecclesiastes 9:10; 11:6; Romans 12:11; 1
Thessalonians 4:11, 12.


FROM THE COMMENTATORS

Man is not made simply to enjoy life; he is to labor and work. Even such
a garden as the one described in verse 9 gives scope for man’s activity;
he is to till it, to develop its capacities, and adapt it to his own
ends, and to keep (Isaiah 27:3) or guard it, against the natural tendency
of a neglected garden to run wild, and against damage from wild animals
or other possible harm.—_The Book of Genesis_, _S. R. Driver_.

But man is not designed solely to till and keep the garden. There are
dormant in him capacities of moral and religious attainment, which must
be exercised, developed, and tested. A command is therefore laid upon
him, adapted to draw out his character, and to form a standard by which
it may be tested. It is a short and simple command, unaccompanied even
by a reason; but it is sufficient for the purpose: man’s full knowledge
of what he must do or not do can be attained only as the result of a
long moral and spiritual development, it cannot exist at the beginning.
And the command relates to something to be avoided: the acknowledgment
and observance of a limitation, imposed upon his creaturely freedom by
his Creator and Lord, must be for man the starting point of everything
else.—_Die Genesis Erklärt_, _August Dillmann_.

It is not enough to place man in the garden: further provision is yet
required for the proper development of his nature, and satisfaction of
its needs, a helper who may in various ways assist him, and who may at
the same time prove a companion, able to interchange thought with him,
and be in other respects his intellectual equal, is still needed.—_The
Book of Genesis_, _S. R. Driver_.

In order to complete man’s happiness three primal laws were given. The
first was work; this was embittered later in consequence of man’s sin,
but is still his greatest blessing, whether he recognizes it as such or
not. We find this to be true, for whenever man evades work, and seeks
pleasure only, his whole nature becomes impoverished, and deprived of the
stability of earnest purpose and responsibility which ought to be his
birthright. The gift of law, even in its rudimentary stages “thou shalt
not,” is the second great blessing to man. The moral law, putting man
into the right relationship between good and evil, is as necessary as the
great laws of the physical world are to the universe. Further, with the
revelation of that law was given also the penalty of transgression. “In
the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die.” “The wages of
sin is death.”—_Bible Lessons for Schools_, _Genesis_, _E. M. Knox_.


AIM

=To help the pupils to realize that work is a part of the infinite plan
for the development of character; to make it evident that it is noble to
be a worker, and to lift the everyday duties of home and school from the
plane of drudgery to that of joyous cooperation in God’s purposes.=


LESSON PREPARATION

The gospel of the dignity of labor has never been adequately preached,
therefore the preparation for this lesson may include the entire reversal
of what has been ground into the teacher’s consciousness from the
beginning until now, concerning the place of work in the world. For many
years people have read the Lord’s words to Adam after the fall, which
consigned him to the task of wresting his sustenance from the unwilling
earth, as if that were the introduction of work into the world, and as if
it were, therefore, brought in simply as a punishment for disobedience.
This was evidently the thought in the mind of the poet who sang,

  Dear work! art thou the curse of God?
    What must his blessing be!

Throwing aside all such misconceptions, read the material for this lesson
with the thought of finding in it how, under the ideal conditions of
Eden, work was given to man which would require the use, and therefore
minister to the development of his physical powers in tilling the ground;
how his mind was given exercise in plans for guarding or “keeping” the
garden and in naming the animals; and how the higher spiritual powers
were called into service when he was given a companion in association
with whom the emotions of love and tenderness would find expression. It
is implied also in Genesis 3:8, that God was wont to meet with Adam and
Eve in the garden and talk with them there.

The picture that we get as we study this passage in this way has in it
the elements of congenial employment, companionship, obedience to the
highest law, and communion with God, and these are exactly the elements
that will bring the nearest approach to the ideal in any life to-day.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

I wonder if you can remember the time when you first began to ask such
questions as these: Who made the world? Who made the moon and stars that
shine in the night, and the sun that lights and warms the day? Who made
the trees and taught them how to grow? Who made all the animals? Who made
the fish that swim in the water and the birds that fly in the air? Have
you ever asked such questions? They are the questions that children have
been asking always, ever since there were any children in the world, and
the story that answers all these questions for us is one that mothers
have told to their children for thousands of years. Do you know what
story I mean? Who can answer the question, “Who made the world?” by using
just one verse from the Bible?


The Lesson Story

Our story to-day is about a garden. It was a beautiful garden, more
beautiful than anything you and I have ever seen. In it were all kinds
of trees and plants, grasses, flowers, and herbs. A river watered the
garden. Animals lived in the garden; birds made their nests in the trees
and flew across the blue of the sky, filling the air with their sweet
songs. Everyone who has heard or read the story of the Garden of Eden
thinks of it as a beautiful place in which there was nothing to distress
or make one afraid.

The story tells us that God made this garden as a home for the man whom
he had created in his own image. “The Lord God took the man and put him
into the Garden of Eden”—to do what do you suppose? Just to amuse himself
all day long? No, God did not put Adam into the garden that he might
have a pleasant place in which to do nothing. He was put into the garden
“to dress it and to keep it.” He was to find the greatest joy working in
the garden, picking the fruits, caring for the growing things, and in
guarding them from anything that might not be good for them. Even in the
garden there was studying to be done; for Adam studied the animals and
the birds, watched them at their play, saw how they lived, and gave to
each a name that was suited to it. This kind of work was pleasant, but
Adam could not make companions of the animals, and though he had work to
do Adam was lonely. God saw that this was so, and he said, “It is not
good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.”
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and
when he awoke he found a woman at his side whom God had given him to be
his companion and friend. Now he was no longer lonely, for he had some
one with him who had a mind and spirit like his own, who could talk with
him and help him in his work as none of the animals could possibly do.
So Adam and Eve were happy in obeying the heavenly Father. They found
pleasure in doing what he told them he would like to have them do, and in
keeping from doing what God had said they must not do. Let us read from
God’s Word just what this was. (Verses 16 and 17.)

When the sun had gone behind the western hills, and the refreshing
breezes of the early evening were making the air sweet and cool, and the
birds were singing their good-night songs, then it was that the sweetest
of all the joys of the day came to the pair in the garden, for we are
told that God walked with them in the cool of the day.

Have you ever thought you would be glad if there were no such thing as
study? Have you ever wished that you could play all day and never do any
work? I suppose all of us have felt that way sometimes, but would it be
best for us? Would we be happy very long if we had nothing to do but
play? Not very long. I have often heard boys and girls say at the end of
the long summer vacation that they were glad to go back to school. And
this story, which pictures for us a garden of beauty and happiness, tells
of study and work as well as play, of loving companionship and through it
all a spirit of cheerful obedience to God. (Memory Text.)


THE PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

Show the picture for this lesson and go over the work for the coming week
as carefully as you think necessary, but not so elaborately as to rob it
of all freshness for the child when he comes to take it up by himself.




LESSON 3

THE CORRELATED LESSON


What was the name of our story last Sunday? In what book is that story
found? In what chapter were your readings for the week? Tell me what
you found in the picture for the lesson. If you were asked to write a
title under the picture what would you choose? (Tell the children they
may write a title in their books.) What work was given to Adam that he
did with his hands? What did he have to think and plan for? What was the
memory text of the lesson? Suppose the heavenly Father had not cared to
have his children do any work, how do you think that verse would have
ended then? “The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden”—to do what? (To have a good time, may be suggested.) Do you think
he would have had a really happy time without anything to do? No: God
himself is not idle, and his children, because made in his image, cannot
be really happy unless they do something worth while with the powers that
he has given them. I suppose there are some kinds of work and study that
you have to do that you do not enjoy doing, but you can do anything if
you remember that it will please the heavenly Father, your own father and
mother, and others who love you. Your play afterward will give you much
more pleasure, and the best of it is that, after a while, you will learn
to like the work. What command did God give to Adam about one of the
trees in the garden?

(Show your book and find out what the pupils have done in theirs.
Discourage emphatically any attempt to do this work ahead of the
lesson-teaching in the school. The tendency in the beginning will
probably be on the part of many to rush ahead with the work while it is
novel, but when the novelty has worn off there will be a reaction and it
will be difficult to get the work done at all. Keep in mind constantly
that one great purpose to be accomplished through the work book this year
is to teach the children to follow instructions implicitly.)

LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Psalm 139:7-12; Proverbs 28:1, 13; Jeremiah 2:17, 19; Romans 5:12-19;

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

As of the tree of life which stands in the paradise of the future it is
said, “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life”; so in Eden man’s immortality was suspended
on the condition of obedience. And the trial of man’s obedience is
imaged in the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
From the childlike innocence in which man originally was, he was to pass
forward into the condition of moral manhood, which consists not in mere
innocence, but in innocence maintained in presence of temptation.... Only
by choosing the good in presence of the evil are true manhood and real
maturity gained.—_The Expositor’s Bible_, _Genesis_, _Marcus Dods_.

Like the great Teacher of Nazareth, the prophetic author of this
marvelous story was dealing with the deepest experiences of human life.
His problem was to make clear and plain even to children the nature of
that inner struggle which we call temptation. He accomplishes his end
by the use of the simple story and dialogue. Attention and interest are
fixed from the first on the experiences of a certain man and woman. The
story has all the personal charm of those fascinating popular tales
which come from the ancient East. Its prologue, the primitive story of
creation, was old centuries before the days of Moses. In the first scene
the actors are the serpent, the woman, and the man. In the dialogue
between the serpent and the woman is brought out vividly the struggle
that raged in her own mind between her natural inclinations and her sense
of duty. In the second scene Jehovah appears. The acts and motives of
the man and woman and the terrible consequences of sin are portrayed so
concretely and dramatically that even the youngest and simplest reader
can fully appreciate them. The thoughtful reader, however, soon discovers
that the marvelous biblical narrative is far more than a mere record
of the experiences of a primitive man and woman. Like the inimitable
parables of Jesus, it is a chapter from the book of life.—_Heroes and
Crises of Early Hebrew History_, _Charles Foster Kent_.

Among the many religious teachings with which this marvelous story
abounds may be noted: (1) Innocence does not become virtue until it is
tested and proved by temptation. (2) If the testing is to be effective,
the temptation must be of a character to appeal to the individual tested.
(3) Sin is not God’s but man’s creation. (4) To sin is to act in accord
with the baser and more selfish rather than the nobler and diviner
motives. (5) An act of sin destroys a man’s peace of mind and purity
of thought. (6) Sin unconfessed is a sin constantly committed, and it
absolutely prevents even God himself from forgiving the unrepentant
sinner. (7) In keeping with the law of cause and effect, sin brings its
own inevitable punishment. (8) The worst effect of sin is the severing
of the normal, harmonious relations between God and the individual. (9)
Most of the pains and ills of life are the result of some one’s sin. (10)
Man must learn in the school of pain and toil the lesson of obedience.
(11) Even though guilty and unrepentant, man is still the object of God’s
unceasing love and care—_Ibid._


AIM

=To show through the story of the first disobedience the character and
consequences of all sin, and to point out the only way to escape from it.=


LESSON PREPARATION

The story that we have in this lesson must make an appeal to every child
because there is no child in our Junior Department who has not had the
experience of being disobedient, and also, doubtless, of trying to hide
both the sin and himself from the one disobeyed. Probably there can be no
more effectual way of beginning the preparation of this lesson than for
the teacher to think back to his own experience as a child, and recall
in what manner he made his way back through repentance and forgiveness
to a complete restoration of the feeling of loving freedom that should
exist between parent and child. The attitude of the one in authority is
always a very important factor, but even with the most wise and loving of
parents or guardians, the natural tendency of the one who transgresses
is to concealment. With the facts of the story clearly in mind and the
memory of one’s own experience as a guide, it should be easy to make the
children realize that disobedience always brings unhappiness in the end,
and a sense of separation from those who love us; that the worst thing
anyone can do is to try to hide a disobedient act, because the only way
to get back to the right road again is through the opposite course—brave
confession instead of cowardly hiding or denying, repentance and the
determination to forsake instead of clinging to the wrong.

Prayer is always the most essential part of our lesson preparation, and
in this lesson especially we need to pray that we may be given such
heavenly wisdom and so much of love in our own hearts that we can make
the children see the heavenly Father as a God of infinite love and
compassion, one who hates sin but loves the sinner. Many people who are
now teaching children have testified that in their own childhood, from
the way in which these Old Testament stories were presented, they saw in
God only an avenging Deity, eager to punish or destroy. We must always
remember that Jesus never presented his Father and ours in that way,
and that he whose life was given to provide a way of escape for sinning
humanity said, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.”


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

(Describe the happy home life of a family of children, each having his
own work to do in the home, each taking a pride in doing his work in
the best way, and tell of the playtime following the work. Picture the
children going down the street to meet their father as he comes home from
work, and the joys of the evening time when all are together. Then tell
of a day when the playtime was not so happy because one of the boys did
not care to play. He said he was not sick, but he certainly was cross,
and took no pleasure in any of the things that he generally loved to do.
When the time came to go to meet father he would not go, but instead went
to his own room. Of course the father missed him and when he found his
boy was not ill he was anxious to know what the trouble could be.) Can
you guess what it was that made Walter wish to hide from his father that
night?


The Lesson Story

What a beautiful garden that was of which we heard last Sunday! And how
happy Adam and Eve were as they did the work God had given them to do,
and enjoyed the loveliness of the place which God had given them for a
home, looking forward each day to the time when he would come and walk
and talk with them there! But there came a sad day, when all that was
changed. The garden was just as beautiful, but Adam and Eve found no
pleasure in it. The work was there to be done, but they had no heart
for it. Open your Bibles to the second chapter of Genesis and read with
me verses 16 and 17. That does not mean that the moment they disobeyed
they would die, but that the sin would open the door for death to enter
the world, and that some day death would come to them as the result of
disobedience.

One day the tempter said to the woman, “Is it possible that God has said
that you must not eat of the fruit of all the trees of the garden?” Eve
answered (Genesis 3:2, 3). The serpent said: “That is not true. You will
not die. The real reason why God does not wish you to eat of the fruit
of that tree is that when you do so you will become as a god yourself,
for you will know good and evil.” It seems strange that Eve would listen
to anyone who said that what God had told her was not true, but she did.
She even began to look at the tree and its fruit and to long to have
it, until, finally, she took it and ate, and gave some to Adam, and he
ate. Then they did know good and evil, for they could remember the days
when they were obedient and the happiness that they had, and now through
shame and fear and the wretchedness of a guilty conscience they saw what
evil is, and that with their own hands they had opened the door to let
it into their lives. There was no longer any joy in the thought of the
heavenly Father’s coming to the garden, and they tried to hide themselves
from him. “Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see
him? saith Jehovah.” How would you answer that question? Of course they
could not hide from God, and it would be the worst possible thing to do
if they could. God knew of the wrong they had done and the punishment
that the sin must bring to them, but his only wish was to help his sinful
children, for he loved them then as always. (Have the children read
verses 9 and 10 to themselves and then answer this question:) What reason
did Adam give for hiding himself? Was that the true reason why he was
afraid? No, for he had been naked before and had never been afraid. It
was his sin that made him afraid. (Read verses 11, 23, 24.)

You have guessed that the boy I told you about in the beginning of the
lesson had disobeyed his father, and that that was the reason why he
wished to hide. You knew because you have sometimes felt like hiding
yourself for the same reason. So you can see how this old, old story
tells what we know is true when it shows us that wrong doing separates us
from the one whom we have disobeyed and makes us miserable. What was it
that spoiled the happy home that Adam and Eve had in the Garden? What was
it that spoiled Walter’s good times? Yes, disobedience; and it is always
so. Those who break God’s law have to suffer for it in some way. But how
glad we are to know that God loves us so much that when we are sorry and
tell him so, he will forgive us and give us a chance to try again. Listen
while I read you something that the Bible says about this. (Psalm 86:5; 1
John 1:9.)


THE PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

There probably will not be anything in the work outlined for this week
that the children cannot easily do. It would be well, however, to call
their attention to the memory text printed on page 8. Have them pronounce
the name of the book from which it is taken, and help them to find the
reference and read the words from the Bible. Ask them what the “a” after
the reference means, and if they do not know, have them read again the
paragraph explaining this on page 3. The easiest way for the children to
find the book of Jeremiah when unfamiliar with any of the books is to
open the Bible in the middle. The book opened to will be Psalms, which
you can explain is the hymn book of the Bible, and then they can turn the
leaves to the right until they reach the book of Jeremiah. Tell them that
the name is that of the man who wrote the book.




LESSON 4

THE CORRELATED LESSON


Get the facts of last Sunday’s story briefly from the children, leaving
most of the time for the answers to Wednesday’s question in the pupil’s
work book concerning what they think Eve should have done when she was
tempted to disobey God. Another question which it will be helpful for
the children to think through and find an answer to is, After Adam and
Eve had disobeyed the heavenly Father, what should they have done right
away when they realized the wrong and felt the shame? If each pupil can
be brought to see, through thinking it out for himself, that the only
possible help for one who has done wrong comes from God, and that Adam
and Eve should have gone to God to confess their sin and ask forgiveness
instead of trying to hide from him, the conclusion will point its own
moral and each child will make his own application.

See how many know the memory text and the name of the book in which it
is found. If there is time, read to the children Psalm 139:7-12, letting
them follow you with the Bible open before them. Ask all to read softly
with you, each making it his own prayer, verses 23 and 24.

LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Job 11:14,15; Romans 6:12,16; Colossians 3:12-14; James 3:14; 5:9.


FROM THE COMMENTATORS

The narrative ... impressively shows how sin, having once appeared,
became hereditary in the human race, and speedily developed into its
most revolting form. Its details enable us to see how jealousy, when
indulged, leads to hatred and murder, and violates not only the ties of
humanity but those of family affection; how the sinner casts off all
regard for the truth and for his natural obligations; how progress in
sin adds to the misery of man’s lot; and “conscience doth make cowards
of us all.” The truths taught are, that God looks on the hearts of his
worshipers, seeks to restrain the sinner ere he yields to passion, marks
the death of the innocent, and graciously mitigates his punishment when
his mercy is sought.—_The One Volume Commentary_, _James R. Dummelow_.

Those who do not serve God hate him who does because they cannot help
wishing that they were like him, yet they have no intention of imitating
him, and this makes them jealous and envious. Instead of being angry with
themselves, they are angry with him.—_Sermons_, _Thomas P. Newman_.

The reason of the rejection of Cain’s offering was that he had not been
“doing well.” (“It would be strange if the gods looked to gifts and
sacrifices and not to the soul.”—Plato.) Notice that the offering is
secondary: _Abel and his offering, Cain and his offering_; the man and
his state of spirit are the important elements.—_Commentary on Genesis_,
_Marcus Dods_.


AIM

=To help the child to feel the beauty and strength of the love that
envieth not, and to awaken within him a desire to possess it.=


LESSON PREPARATION

Envy is defined as “selfish ill-will toward another because of his
superior success, endowments, or possessions.” It is a feeling which
is apt to be displayed by children comparatively early because of
the greater success of their classmates in school, or of the larger
possessions of those whose parents have either more money or less wisdom
in spending it than their own. It is so ugly a trait and so insidious
in its attacks that it is well to have a lesson like this which shows
the sin in its most hideous form. The story of Joseph’s brethren, who
hated him because he was more worthy than they, and of Saul, who viewed
with murderous jealousy the popularity of the young David, are other
instances of the direction in which envy inevitably carries those who
yield to it. In preparing the lesson imagine how the two boys probably
differed in their boyhood, for “great crimes are committed only by men
whose characters have been gradually debased by lesser sins.” Kent points
out nine vital truths illustrated by the story of which the preceding
quotation is one. Another which Juniors would be able to understand is
that God patiently points out to the offender the right way and endeavors
to influence him to follow it. Another is guilt unconfessed cuts a person
off from his fellows.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

I am thinking of a strange picture in which a flaming sword that turns in
every direction closes the way into a garden. Back in the distance I can
see a place over which the sun is shining with warmth and beauty. Trees
and plants and birds and flowers are all glad in the sunshine, and the
animals are running and playing for very joy; but there are no people
there. What garden is it that I see? Were there ever any people in it?
Who were they? What command was given to them there? When they disobeyed
that command they could no longer live in that beautiful home, and when
they went out from it the flaming sword was placed there to show them
that they could never hope to go back to the place where they had been
so happy while they were innocent and obedient children of the heavenly
Father.

Suppose some one should ask us to tell how people might have a happy
home in these days—what would we say? I should say that first of all
the people in the home must love and be glad to help each other. (Let
the children express their own ideas freely but guide the conversation
so that the essentials of obedience, cheerfulness, and kindness will be
mentioned.)


The Lesson Story

I have a story to tell you to-day about two brothers. When the first one
was born his mother named him Cain, and as she looked at him she said to
herself, “I hope my boy will be strong to fight against evil.” But as he
grew older the face of the mother became sad as she watched her boy, for
soon she saw that he was yielding to evil tempers instead of fighting
against them. After a time another baby boy came to the home, and he was
called Abel. Together the two boys grew, the father and mother teaching
them and hoping the best things for them. When each was old enough to
choose the way in which he would make his living Cain became a farmer
and tilled the ground, planting seed and raising fruits and grains. Abel
became a shepherd and spent his time raising and caring for his sheep.

It seems from the story that Abel succeeded better than Cain, and Cain
became envious and jealous of his brother. The Bible does not tell us so,
but we may be quite sure that Abel was a cheery, pleasant, unselfish,
helpful son to his father and mother, and that Cain was gloomy, selfish,
and cross in the home. Cain saw the difference between his brother and
himself, but instead of trying to be like Abel he simply hated him for
his goodness.

During their boyhood days Cain and Abel had seen their father bring
offerings to the Lord, and as boys they had taken their part with their
father and mother in the family worship; but when they were grown men
each must do for himself what their father had done for them when they
were young. So it came to pass that Cain and Abel brought their offerings
to God, Cain bringing some of the fruits that he had raised, and Abel
bringing the best of his flock. God was glad to accept the offerings of
Abel because the spirit in which Abel brought his gift was one of love
and joy. God can read the very thoughts of our hearts, and as he looked
at Cain he saw envy and jealousy and hatred choking every good thing in
his life, and because he was cherishing such evil thoughts, his offering
could not be acceptable to the God of love. When Cain saw that his
offering was not accepted he became very angry, he scowled and hung his
head. Then the Lord said to Cain: “Why are you angry, and why is your
countenance fallen? If you will do what is right, you will please me. If
you do wrong, sin is like a wild beast crouching at your door, wishing
to destroy you; but you can rule over it if you will.” See how tenderly
the heavenly Father showed Cain his wrong, and tried to help him back
into the right way. But Cain let sin, that is like a wild beast, stay at
his door, and did not try to conquer it. After a while he said to his
brother Abel, “Let us go out into the field,” and when they were in the
field alone together, Cain in his envy and hatred of his brother rose up
against him and killed him. Open your Bibles at the fourth chapter of
Genesis and read with me verses 9 and 10. God told Cain that he would be
from that day a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Cain answered, “My
punishment is greater than I can bear, for I shall be driven away from
thy face, and anyone who finds me will kill me.” But the Lord appointed
a sign for Cain which would show people that they must not kill him, and
Cain went away from his father’s house.

Sin had ruined another life. As it had driven Adam and Eve from the
Garden of Eden, so now it drove Cain away from his home, and left his
father and mother in the greatest sorrow they had ever known.

How dreadful envy, jealousy, and hatred are, and how much unhappiness
they have brought into the world. Is there anything strong enough to
conquer this sin which God said is like a wild beast? Yes, love is
stronger than anything else in the world. Envy cannot even stay where
love is. “God is love,” the Bible says, and he will help us to be loving
and kind if we ask him. “Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth
not.” (Have this text repeated, and if the conditions are such that you
can do so, close with a sentence prayer.)


THE PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

Read to the class the directions given under Thursday’s work for finding
1 Corinthians 13:4a, and let them find the verse without comment or
other explanation on your part, in order to make sure that they are able
to follow such printed directions. Of course it is important that they
should be able to find the verse, as it is the memory text of the lesson.




LESSON 5

THE CORRELATED LESSON


Home Preparation

Take some small blank cards or slips of heavy paper and prepare them
for use in the class by writing plainly on one side and on the other
these things: First card (1) Genesis, (2) Beginnings. Second card (1)
Genesis 1:1, (2) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Third card (1) What story is in Genesis, chapter 2? (2) In what book and
chapter is the story of the Garden of Eden? Fourth card (1) What story
is in Genesis, chapter 3? (2) In what book and chapter is the story of
the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? Fifth card (1)
What story is in Genesis, chapter 4? (2) In what book and chapter would
you look for the story of Cain and Abel? Sixth card (1) Where is the
verse that begins, “Love suffereth long”? (2) Repeat 1 Corinthians 13:4a.
Seventh card (1) Where could you find the question that begins, “Can any
hide himself in secret places”? (2) Repeat Jeremiah 23:24a. Eighth card
(1) What is the meaning of the word “Bible”? (2) The Book. Ninth card (1)
How many parts has the Bible, and what are they? (2) Two, Old Testament
and New Testament. Tenth card (1) The Bible contains how many books? (2)
Sixty-six. Eleventh card (1) How many books in the New Testament? (2)
Twenty-seven. Twelfth card (1) How many books in the Old Testament? (2)
Thirty-nine.


Review in Class

Explain to the pupils that each one is to have a card on which is some
question, and if he can answer it, he is to keep the card, if he cannot
answer it, the one next to him on the left may try, and so on around the
class. If no one can answer, the card is to be laid aside to be drilled
on later. If it is answered, the one who gives the correct answer keeps
the card. Most of the cards are made out in such a way that it makes no
particular difference which side up they are placed; that is, whichever
side is up will suggest to one who knows what is on the other side. But
in the questions on the Bible, books, etc., the cards should be placed
with the question up. Of course it is obvious that the pupil who has the
most cards in his possession at the end of the review has done the best
work in it.




LESSON 5

Review


=Teaching Material.=—Genesis, chapters 1-4.

=Pupil’s Work.=—Answering questions and reading Genesis 4:20-22.


LESSON PREPARATION

Read at one sitting the first four chapters of Genesis, and then think
through the stories to get at the inner meaning which you have tried
to bring to the children. The class review with the cards will have
brought the more mechanical facts that have been learned sufficiently to
mind. This review should emphasize the truths that the stories hold in
solution, but should do this, not by dogmatizing concerning them, but
by leading the children to make the statements for themselves. Because
of the natural interest of children in the origin of things enough new
matter is introduced in the Pupil’s Book for Work and Study to give the
names of the persons to whom are ascribed the originating of tent life,
music, and the making of instruments of metal. These things should not be
touched upon in this lesson, however, but left as a surprise for the home
work.


LESSON PRESENTATION

Recite to the children the lines from Joseph Addison’s hymn, “The
Spacious Firmament on High” (quoted in the first lesson). Why is it that
the sun, the moon and the stars make people think of the power of God?
What else that you see every day reminds you of God’s handiwork? Can you
tell the story which was given us in the Bible to teach us that God made
all things? (Have the story told briefly and as nearly as possible in the
Bible words.)

What is the name of the beautiful home which God gave to Adam? What
did Adam have to do in the garden? Why could not the animals be his
true companions and friends? What did God do for him? (Let the children
describe what they think might have been a day in the life of Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Mention the two trees and the command
concerning them if the children do not do so, and see if without any
reminder or suggestion from you, they tell that in the cool of the
evening God walked with the pair in the garden.)

What a happy home that was in the Garden of Eden! Were Adam and Eve
always happy there? How was it that one day instead of looking forward
with joy to the time when God would come to talk with them, they tried to
hide from him? Yes, they had not been strong enough or loving enough to
obey, and having been disobedient, they were afraid to meet God. Was it
right for them to try to hide? What should they have done?

We had a story of two brothers. What were their names? (Let the children
tell the story briefly.) What was it that made Cain do such a dreadful
thing? Could he have conquered the sin that crouched like a wild beast at
the door of his heart, if he had tried?

I am going to ask you four questions, and I think you can answer each one
of them in the words of a Bible verse. Who made the world? What did God
give Adam to do in the Garden of Eden? Can anyone hide from God? Tell me
two things that love does and one that love will never do.




LESSON 6

THE CORRELATED LESSON


(As the references to Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal-cain are the first passages
that have been given in the pupil’s book without being first presented
in the class, it will be interesting to see how well the children have
succeeded in getting at the facts.)

What was our picture for this last week? How many people were there in
it? What were they doing? What was the name of the man who is called “the
father of all who play upon the harp and the organ”? So we found from our
Book which tells us of the beginnings of things, that way back in the
ages of long ago people learned how to make instruments of music and to
play upon them. To-day we have wonderful instruments, great pipe organs,
violins, pianos, cornets and other instruments of brass, and whenever
we see these or hear their music we will remember that the Bible tells
us that the one who first thought of making music in that way was named
Jubal.

When a man is taking care of large herds of cattle, what does he need to
find for them? It is not easy to find pasture for a great many cattle,
and it would be very tiresome and even impossible to go back every night
to the home. It would not be comfortable to sleep on the ground with no
protection from the rain or cold. Who was it that first thought of having
a tent to live in, and carrying it with him wherever he went? So Jabal
was the father of all such as take care of cattle and live in tents. Are
there any people to-day who live in tents all their lives?

(With a class of boys the reference to Tubal-cain could be introduced
by asking for a penknife and getting the pupils to tell of the man who
first thought of making tools and weapons out of metal. Ask if anything
is being invented to-day. Lead the children to see that the possibilities
of discovery and invention are by no means exhausted, and help them to
realize the wisdom and love of God in giving to man power to think out
such things.)

LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Psalm 103:17, 18; Proverbs 1:33; 19:16; Jeremiah 18:7-10; Ezekiel
33:14-16; Matthew 24:35-39.


FROM THE COMMENTATORS

The narrative here becomes more circumstantial than it has been in
chapters four and five, for the Flood is the first event of crucial
importance since the Creation and the beginnings of man upon earth
(chapters one to three), of which Hebrew tradition told. The Flood marks
the end of a past age and the beginning of a new one; it is thus an event
in which the purposes of God may be expected to declare themselves with
peculiar distinctness; and it is, accordingly, treated as the occasion
of a great manifestation both of judgment (chapter 6) and of mercy (8:15
to 9:17). The Flood is a judgment upon a degenerate race: Noah, with
his family, is delivered from it on account of his righteousness; as
humanity starts upon its course afresh, new promises and new blessings
are conferred upon it.—_The Book of Genesis_, _S. R. Driver_.

What, then, is the purpose of inspiration? Is it to insure that we shall
have clear and infallible information on certain questions of geology and
astronomy, or on the way in which God created the heavens and the earth?
Is it to keep us from mistakes about the history of Israel?... Surely
not. God had no intention of giving us an encyclopedia of scientific
knowledge, and thus depriving us of the discipline of acquiring such
knowledge for ourselves.... Inspiration is concerned with what is to
us of infinitely more importance—even the guidance of our conduct,
the building up of noble characters for God. It has been well said
that conduct forms three fourths of human life, and it is with these
three fourths that the inspired writings have to do. Their inspiration
therefore consists not so much in their infallible science or minutely
accurate details of history, as in their teaching God’s will and God’s
relation to men.... These writings concern themselves with the great
moral and spiritual facts, duty, character, moral responsibility, the
happiness that comes from harmony with the will of God. Their object is
to teach the eternal contrast between Righteousness and Unrighteousness,
Obedience and Disobedience, Selfishness and Self-sacrifice, Purity and
Lust; to teach men that God is on the side of holiness and good, that his
help and sympathy are near in the fierce fight with temptation, and that
even when the fight is lost and the life defiled, there is a way back to
holiness and God if men will but earnestly seek it.—_How God Inspired the
Bible_, _J. Paterson Smyth_.

They (the Scriptures) conveyed to the Hebrews, and they still convey to
us, the worthiest conceptions of God and of His relation to the world and
men. They are a standing witness to the fact that the nation of Israel
enjoyed a peculiar revelation of the true God. If the “folk-lore” of the
Hebrews, like that of all other peoples, was inconsistent at many points
with our modern knowledge of nature and history, yet it was so purified
among them, under the guidance of the Spirit of God, from all taint of
heathenism, that, as it stands in the opening chapters of Genesis, it
contains nothing inconsistent either with the religion of Jehovah or with
the fuller revelation of Jesus Christ.—_The One Volume Bible Commentary_,
_J. R. Dummelow_.


AIM

=To present the ideal of unquestioning obedience to the commands of God,
and through the story to deepen the impulse to choose and do the right.=


LESSON PREPARATION

A careful study of the passage of Scripture assigned for the teacher in
this lesson presents much that is interesting and many points that are
puzzling. For one’s own information and satisfaction it would be well
to read the article on the Deluge in any good Bible dictionary and to
consult commentaries on the narrative. But in preparing the lesson for
the pupil attention must be centered on the story as given in the verses
that the pupil is to read. The simple account of the one man who was
“righteous,” “perfect [or blameless] in his generation,” and who “walked
with God” in loving obedience, when the “wickedness of man was great in
the earth,” and “every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually,” is one that makes a strong appeal to the children. The
building of the ark; the surprise of the people as they saw a boat built
upon dry land, and their undoubted ridicule of Noah; his opportunity
for preaching righteousness; the completion of the ark and the going
in of the animals, Noah and his family, are the elements of a story of
surpassing interest, which carries also a strong religious impression in
its emphasis upon obedience and its reward. The negative side should not
be dwelt upon.

The teacher will need to note carefully just the point in the story
where this lesson ends. The story is so generally told as a whole,
including the building of the ark, its completion, the going in of
animals and people, the coming of the rain, the rising of the waters, the
final settling of the ark on dry land, and the going out of Noah and his
family and the animals, that the natural tendency will be to encroach
upon next week’s lesson without meaning to do so.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

(Have your Work Book open at page 14.) We had some rules last week in our
Work Book, and they were headed, “How to Have a Happy Home.” How many of
you read those rules? Suppose I read them very carefully now, and you
see if you think any of them might be left out of the list. Which one of
these rules do you think is the hardest of all to obey? (If the children
do not speak of it themselves, call their attention to “Be willing and
obedient,” and explain that it means not simply to do what you are told
to do, but to do it willingly and cheerfully.) It is often hard to obey,
because the command is to do some hard or disagreeable thing, and the
harder it is to obey, the more temptation there is to do unwillingly
what we are told to do, and to be cross about it. When one obeys in that
spirit all the beauty of the obedience is taken away. One who obeys
willingly will soon find that he can obey cheerfully, and it is only such
obedience that is pleasing to the heavenly Father.


The Lesson Story

I have a beautiful story to tell you to-day of a man who obeyed in just
that way. The name of this man was Noah. In his time there were many
people living in the world, but, except Noah and his family, no one of
them cared to please God, and they did not even try to obey him. The
Bible tells us that “the earth was filled with violence,” and that God
said the evil doers must be destroyed. But Noah was not one of these, and
to him God said something like this: “The people are so wicked and cruel
that I shall have to send a flood upon the earth which will destroy all
those who are doing such evil things, but I want you to build an ark in
which you and your wife and children shall be saved.” This ark was to be
a great boat three stories high, with rooms in it, and a large door in
the side. Just as soon as Noah knew what God wanted him to do he bought
the wood and hired carpenters and began the work of building the ark.
(Show the picture for this lesson.) Do you think it was an easy task
to build that ark in a land full of wicked people? Of course, when his
neighbors saw what he was doing they were curious to know what this great
building was to be. When he told them, can you imagine how they would
laugh at him for building a boat on dry land, and how they would laugh
harder still when he said there was to be a flood? It must have been hard
for Noah to stand their ridicule, but he never thought of giving up the
work. He did a braver thing than just keeping on with the building, too,
for all through the years he was at work the Bible says that he was “a
preacher of righteousness.” He told the people of the punishment that
was surely coming, and urged them to give up their wicked ways and do
the sort of things that would be pleasing to the heavenly Father. But
they would not listen, and would not believe what he told them. Still
Noah kept patiently on working and preaching until the ark was finished.
Then God said to his faithful servant, “Before very long I will bring
the flood of waters upon the earth.” Let us read what it says in the
Bible about the things that Noah was to do before the flood came (Genesis
6:19-21). Do you suppose that Noah did all that just as God had told him
to do? Let us read that next verse very carefully together: “Thus did
Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.” Is not that a
splendid thing to be said about any man? Let us read the words again and
then close our books and say them, for that is our memory text this week,
and it is one that we would like always to remember, I am sure.

The Bible says that God told Noah what he wanted him to do. How does God
tell you and me what he wants us to do? (Guide the conversation so that
the children themselves will mention the Bible, God’s message, and the
Sunday school and church where the meaning of the message is explained to
us and where we try to help each other to be doers of the Word. Teachers
at school and those who guide and direct in the home should also be
mentioned.) You see that as you obey these helpers that God has given to
you, you are learning to do according to all that God has commanded you.
What has Jesus said of those who hear the Word of God and keep it? (Luke
11: 28.) “Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
he.” Shall we not ask the heavenly Father to help us to be so strong to
obey and so willing that something like that may be said of us too?


Prayer

(To be used if the conditions in the room and the spirit of the class
make possible a quiet moment in which heads may be bowed, and the words,
softly spoken by the teacher, heard by all the members of the class.)

Our Father in heaven, we are glad that we have the Bible with its stories
of people who loved and obeyed thee in the long ago. May we learn from
these stories how to be more obedient to-day. Help us to be cheerful,
loving doers of the Word. We ask it in Jesus’ name. Amen.




LESSON 7

THE CORRELATED LESSON


Use your own copy of the pupil’s book, and let the children talk over the
lesson on the Building of the Ark freely and informally. If you should
find that any one of the class has been dwelling in thought upon the
people outside of the ark, and wondering why it was necessary that all
of them should be destroyed, have them read Genesis 6: 11, and help them
to see that people who choose to live in sin cannot be saved from its
consequences. “Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him” (Psalm
140: 11. See also Galatians 6: 7, 8).

People were sowing violence and reaping violence. Human life was not
respected. God’s laws were scorned and ignored. There had to be a new
beginning for the world, if there were to be any people left in it.

Do not refer to this side of the question unless the children speak of
it. If they do, emphasize the patience of God and the warnings that were
given through Noah’s preaching and the added force that his words would
have because of the actual building of the ark going on daily before
their eyes.

Give the children this name drill, telling them not to answer any
question that cannot be answered by a name. Who lived in the Garden of
Eden? Who was told to build an ark? We had a story about two brothers:
what was the name of the older one? The younger? How many people
went into the ark? (This should not be answered because it cannot be
answered by a name.) Who is said to have been the first to make musical
instruments? Who is called the father of all who live in tents? What is
the name of the book in which our lessons are found?

Who is said to have been the first man to think about making weapons and
tools out of metal? What is the name of the first story in the Bible? In
that story what did God make first? What did God call the light? What
name was given to the darkness? What was the gathering together of the
waters called? What is the light that rules the day? What is the lesser
light that rules the night? What other lights are there in the sky at
night?

LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Isaiah 54: 9, 10; Jeremiah 33: 19-21, 25, 26.


FROM THE COMMENTATORS

The Noachian covenant guarantees the stability of natural law. The
covenant with Abraham was confirmed in its promise to Isaac and Jacob and
insured a blessing through their seed to all nations.... Of still greater
significance was the covenant at Horeb or Sinai.... It was really a
constitution given to Israel by God, with appointed promise and penalty,
duly inscribed on the tables of the covenant which were deposited in the
ark.—_Bible Dictionary_, _Hastings_.

As the expulsion from paradise and the exile of Cain gave to mankind
a _new chance_, a fresh start, so with the flood. Wickedness had by
this time so prevailed that the earth needed to be washed from sin; but
God did not repeople it with a new race set above the possibility of
wrong-doing—rather, the race of man was given a new opportunity. The
moral necessity of the catastrophe is emphasized by God’s long attempt—in
the preaching of Noah for a hundred and fifty years—to win men back
to goodness, to induce a voluntary change of heart. The outstanding
feature of the story is the covenant, which henceforth runs through the
history of Israel, and of the spiritual Israel.... The emphasis laid
upon the sanctity of life is especially worthy of note. The sons of Noah
might well have believed that God held life cheap after its widespread
destruction. Observe, therefore, the insistence upon this command, and
that its sanction is still the same as before the almost universal
appalling wickedness—that man is made in the image of God. The principle
of the flood is not destruction but salvation, as was that of the
sentence of death upon Adam. By the flood the danger of departing from
God was emphasized for all generations.—_Telling Bible Stories_, _Louise
Seymour Houghton_.

This word (covenant) occurs some two hundred times in the Old Testament,
and the idea lies at the root of the whole conception of law among the
Jews. Covenants as made between men, form the beginnings of civilized
government.... The word is also used of the relation of God to man; of
his justice, his unchangeable nature, and his protecting power, on the
one side, and the corresponding duties devolving upon man, especially as
embodied in the law of Moses, on the other. A series of covenants (with
Abraham and his successors, with Israel in the wilderness, with David)
runs through Old Testament history. The particular idea in the covenant
with Noah is that of the uniform working of God in nature and of his
loving care for his creation. On these two ideas are based all physical
science, which could not exist if there were no laws of nature, and all
religion, which otherwise would become mere superstitious dread of unseen
powers.—_The One Volume Commentary_, _James R. Dummelow_.


AIM

=To associate the thought of God’s promises with the rainbow, and to show
that his promise is to bless and that our part is to obey=.


LESSON PREPARATION

There are so many details in this story that are interesting to children
that the main task in preparing the lesson, after becoming thoroughly
familiar with those details, is so to arrange the different items that
the climax shall stand out clearly, and the full force be given to the
point of greatest teaching value as stated in the aim of the lesson.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

One summer day Alice and Kate and Robert were playing out under the trees
on the lawn and having a fine time, when it seemed to them as if the sun
had been put out as suddenly as an electric light is turned off. They
looked up and saw that there were heavy black clouds all over the sky.
“Run,” said Robert, “it is going to rain.” They hurried as fast as they
could, but had barely time to pick up their toys and rush to the veranda
before the rain came down in torrents. They found a sheltered place where
the rain did not beat in and settled themselves to play, but they had
hardly started a new game before the sun shone out as suddenly as it had
disappeared a few minutes before. “It has stopped raining,” said Alice.
“Yes,” said Kate, “but look at those dark clouds.” Robert ran to the
steps that he might see the clouds better, and exclaimed, “O, come quick
and look! It goes all the way across the sky.” What do you suppose he
saw? Have you ever seen a rainbow? What is the first thing you do when
you see one? Probably we all want to do as Robert did and call every one
within calling distance to come and see it, for it is so beautiful. In
the long, long ago I suppose children did that same thing when they saw a
rainbow, but I am sure they did something else too. I think they ran to
their mothers or fathers and said, “Won’t you please tell us the story
of the rainbow?” The story of which those fathers and mothers always
thought when they saw the rainbow and the one which they told to their
children is the one that I am going to tell to you to-day. Perhaps they
called it just what it is called in our books—the Story of the Flood and
the Rainbow. It is another story about the man who built the ark. What
was his name? (Review briefly.) What is the verse which tells us how Noah
obeyed God?


The Lesson Story

Finally there came a day when God told Noah to take into the ark his
wife, his three sons and their wives, together with “every beast after
its kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing
that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind.
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two, of all flesh,
wherein is the breath of life.” When all were safely in the door was
shut. Then the rain came and the waters rose high and higher until all
the mountains were covered. Upon the waste of waters the ark floated.
Days and weeks and months went by, still the waters were over everything.
Then God caused a high wind to pass over the earth and the waters began
to go down. One day Noah opened the window of the ark and sent a raven
out and the raven did not come back. Then Noah sent out a dove, but the
dove found no rest for her foot and came back to the ark, and Noah took
her in. After waiting seven days more, Noah sent the dove out again and
at evening time of that day she came back and in her bill she brought an
olive leaf. The olive trees grow only in valleys, so Noah knew that the
water must have dried off the earth. He waited seven days more and sent
the dove out again, but this time she did not return. Then Noah removed
the covering of the ark and looked, and behold the face of the ground was
dry. And God spake to Noah saying, “Go forth from the ark, thou and thy
wife, and thy sons and thy sons’ wives with thee. Bring forth with thee
every living thing, both birds and cattle and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth.”

So Noah and his family once more stood in God’s sunshine upon the dry
land. The first thing that Noah did after leaving the ark was to build an
altar to the Lord and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. God was pleased
with Noah’s sacrifice and gave him a promise that never again should
the earth be destroyed by flood, and he said: “While the earth remains,
seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night
shall not cease.” Just then the sun shone brightly against a dark cloud,
and a brilliant rainbow spanned the sky. God said, “This is the sign of
the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature
that is with you, for endless generations. I do set my bow in the cloud,
and it shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth.”

So with the bow shining against the cloud mothers and fathers told this
story to their children. To them the rainbow was the sign of God’s
covenant—his promise to bless the earth and all who live upon it. They
remembered something else when they saw it and that is that they had
a part in the covenant. God’s part was to bless; theirs to obey. The
rainbow will remind us, too, of God’s promise. When we see it stretching
across the heavens, in our hearts we will praise the heavenly Father for
his loving kindness, and ask him to help us to be his obedient children.
How glad we are that he has said, “for endless generations,” because that
means that his blessing will be for always and always.

II. STORIES OF THREE PATRIARCHS




LESSON 8


We enter now upon the second period of our course, and for the next
thirteen lessons will follow the fortunes of the three great patriarchs
of Jewish history. The same lesson of simple and unquestioning obedience
is found in these stories, with an occasional negative lesson, showing
the consequences of disobedience. As the promise to Abram points to the
coming of the Messiah, in whom all the nations of the earth were to be
blessed, the Christmas Lesson chosen for this year is upon the Song of
Mary, which ends with a reference to the promise given to her as the
fulfillment of the promise given to Abram.


THE CORRELATED LESSON

I wonder what you will think about the next time you see a rainbow in
the sky. Tell me what God said about the rainbow to Noah. God’s promise
to Noah is only one of hundreds of promises that are in this book, and
the best of it is, those promises are for you and me as well as for the
people who lived in the days when the Bible was written. Do you see the
bookmark I have in my Bible to-day?[3] It has in it the colors of the
rainbow, which people have called the “bow of promise,” and that is one
reason why we like to have a rainbow bookmark for the Bible. It reminds
us of such beautiful promises as this: “I will instruct thee and teach
thee in the way which thou shalt go.” “I am with thee and will keep thee
whithersoever thou goest.” This bookmark is useful in another way. The
Bible has how many books? Now those sixty-six books are not all of one
kind. Some are poetry, some are sermons, some are history and some are
law. These ribbons mark the different kinds of books and so help us to
handle the Bible more easily. Some day you will know all the kinds of
books that the ribbons mark, but just now you need only remember one.
The red ribbon marks the first five books which are called books of Law.
(Have the children repeat this.)

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

Either during the reign of Hammurabi, or shortly before he established
his rule, the migration of Abram from the Babylonian city called “Ur of
the Chaldees” in the biblical narrative, into the land of Canaan, is
supposed to have occurred.... Though he and his descendants, for a long
period, were dwellers in tents, living a nomadic tribal life, like that
of their near relatives, the nomadic Arabs, he had come from a country
of considerable civilization, where writing and the keeping of records
were common, and he had not left that state of civilization behind, ...
for “the power and influence of Babylonia had been firmly established for
centuries throughout the length and breadth of western Asia.”—_The Rise
and Fall of Nations_, _J. N. Larned_.

With the spirit of the true prophet, Abraham leaves behind all that men
usually cherish most and sets out on his long journey. In Canaan also he
disregards his personal interests and is intent only upon knowing and
doing the will of God.

Self-sacrificing, courageous, obedient to the voice of God—he is
supremely worthy to be the father of a prophetic nation. Blessed was
the race that had such a character held up thus prominently before
it!—_Heroes and Crises of Early Hebrew History_, _Charles Foster Kent_.

In the simple, unhesitating faith with which Abram acted at once and to
the fullest, on every intimation of the Divine Will, lay the supreme
distinction which gained him his two unique titles—the “Father of the
Faithful,” and “The Friend of God.”—_Old Testament Characters_, _Geikie_.


AIM

=To present again the ideal of unquestioning obedience; to give an
impulse toward the attaining of this ideal by showing that the obedient
are friends of God and a source of blessing to their fellows.=


LESSON PREPARATION

Besides the study of the Bible passages, and what the commentators have
to say concerning the incident of our lesson, there are many legends of
Abram which are intensely interesting and relate to the protests which
he made against the idolatry of his father and of the people among whom
he lived. [See History for District and Graded Schools, Ellwood W. Kemp,
chapter on “What the Hebrews Taught the World”; _Leben Abraham’s_, by
Beer, quoted by Geikie in Old Testament Characters; The Talmud.] In
studying this story with the children in mind we must remember that our
own point of view concerning leaving one’s country and kindred to go out,
not knowing whither, is a far different one from that which the children
themselves will have. To them moving has in it the attractive element of
novelty, and all the charm of the “unexpected” in every day’s experience
for some time after the move has been made. They have not yet become
so thoroughly attached to the place where they live as to be able to
comprehend in the least the sacrifice that Abram made, and if we could
examine the contents of their minds by some kind of X-ray process, we
would doubtless discover that they were looking upon Abram’s experience
in that respect as one to be coveted. This may explain why teachers of
Junior children have often found this story tame and uninteresting from
the children’s point of view.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

You may be quite sure that any child old enough to be in the Junior
Department has had stories of the Pilgrims and Puritans several times
in his day school course. One good way of introducing this lesson,
therefore, would be to question concerning the Pilgrims, and why they
came to this country, developing the fact that they cared more to worship
God as they thought they should than for anything else that life could
give. They were ready to give up their comfortable homes, their friends,
their relatives, and go into a strange land where no homes awaited them,
and suffer privations, cold, and dangers, because they knew that in that
strange land they would be free to worship God in their own way. From
this it would be easy to pass to the story of a man who took his family,
his servants, and all that he owned and went into a strange land of which
he knew nothing, because he had heard the voice of God telling him to go.

Another method of approach would be by calling attention to the names
by which some men have been called, which they have won for themselves
by the things that they did. George Washington was called the father of
his country. Why? To-day we have a story of a man who earned a much more
wonderful name even than that.


The Lesson Story

It was a long, long time after Noah and the seven who were with him went
out of the ark and heard God’s covenant with them and saw its beautiful
sign in the sky. Now there were many people in the earth, and though they
were not so wicked as the people had been before the Flood, they had
forgotten the God to whom Noah built his altar and offered sacrifices,
and from whom he heard the promise of blessing. Instead of worshiping Him
who is the maker of the heavens and the earth, they were worshiping the
sun and the moon and the stars, and even idols made by men. Of course
they could not obey the God whom Noah served when they were giving all
their thought to idols, neither could God speak to them, because they
would not listen to his voice.

Among the people who were descended from Shem, the oldest son of Noah,
there was a man named Terah, who lived in Ur of the Chaldees. He made up
his mind to take his family and move away from the place where he was
then living to Canaan, a country far from Ur. We do not know just why he
decided to do this, but he started from Ur with his son Abram, his nephew
Lot, and Abram’s wife, Sarai. They did not go to Canaan, but stopped at
a place called Haran, and there Terah died. Terah was a worshiper of
idols, but Abram, his son, had somehow kept the faith in the one true
God, and did not bow down to the moon or stars or to idols of wood or
stone. Because Abram loved the heavenly Father, God could speak to him,
and Abram could hear God’s voice, and his love made him wish to do just
what God asked him to do. So it happened that at Haran Abram heard God
speaking to him, and saying, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee.”
God did not tell Abram where he wanted him to go, he only said, “I will
show you the land,” but he gave him a wonderful promise, for he said, “I
will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy
name great; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”

Now, Abram not only loved God but he believed that God knew what was the
best for him, and that God would do just what he promised. So Abram did
leave his country and his relatives and friends. “By faith Abram when he
was called, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.” Taking
his wife, his nephew, his flocks, and servants, he started from Haran,
and God led him down into the land of Canaan, the very land to which
Terah had intended to go when he left Ur. No doubt, as Abram journeyed he
kept saying to himself as he entered a new part of the country, “I wonder
if this is the land where the Lord wants me to live.” But as no sign was
given, he kept on until he came to Shechem, in the land of Canaan, and
there he found that he had reached the land to which the Lord had called
him to go. Let us read from the Bible just what happened there (Genesis
12:6, 7). The Canaanites were heathen people, and on all sides Abram saw
idols and idol worship. But he knew something far better than that, and
as he journeyed through the land he built altars to the true God and
offered sacrifices wherever he pitched his tents.

In all this Abram was earning a name for himself, though he did not
know it. He loved God so much that he listened for his voice. When God
spoke he obeyed gladly; and he showed his love by praise and prayer and
worship. Would you like to know the name that Abram earned? It is one
that has been given to him through the thousands of years since he lived,
and it is the most beautiful name that anyone could ever have. He is
called “The Friend of God.”


PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

Ask the children if they would like to see the place in the Bible where
Abram is called the friend of God, and help them to find James 2:23. Then
show them the first line on page 25 of the work book on which they are to
write the last four words of that verse.




LESSON 9

THE CORRELATED LESSON


What did I tell you the first five books in the Bible are called? (Books
of Law.) What is the color of the ribbon for those books in our rainbow
bookmark? Let us see how many of our memory texts belong with the red
ribbon. Where is the verse that tells about the creation of the world?
(Genesis 1:1.) Where is the verse that tells what God gave Adam to do in
the Garden of Eden? (Genesis 2:15.) There was one about Noah—where will
we find that? (Genesis 6:22.) And one about the rainbow—(Genesis 9:13).
All these are in the first book—the book of Genesis, and because that
is one of the books of the Law I will give you a red slip to mark the
place of each of those verses. What was the verse about hiding from God?
That verse was in the book of Jeremiah. Let me tell you how to find it.
Open the Bible in the middle. What book is there? (Psalms.) Now turn to
the right and you will find first Proverbs, then Ecclesiastes, Song of
Solomon and Isaiah, and then comes the book we are looking for—Jeremiah.
Turn through the chapters until you find the 23d, and the 24th verse of
that chapter. This book belongs in a group of five that are called books
of the Major Prophets and they are marked by the green ribbon. (Give the
children a green slip and let them put it in as a mark for the memory
text in Jeremiah.) What was the verse about love? That is in one of the
books of the New Testament. If you take the part of your Bible that is
to the right of Jeremiah and open that part in the middle and then take
the right hand little part and open that in the middle, you will find you
have 1 Corinthians. Then you can find the 13th chapter and the 4th verse.
The ribbon for these books, which are called Letters, is violet, so we
will put a violet slip in to mark the place of this memory text. (The
only other text which they have had is Hebrews 11:8a, c. They can find
that by turning to the right from 1 Corinthians, and that may also be
marked by a violet strip of paper. Drill by having the children find the
verses by subjects.)

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

This choice of Sodom as a dwelling place was the great mistake of Lot’s
life. He is the type of that very large class of men who have but one
rule for determining them at the turning points of life. He was swayed
solely by the consideration of worldly advantage. He has nothing deep,
nothing high in him. He recognizes no duty to Abram, no gratitude, no
modesty; he has no perception of spiritual relations.... It was Abram’s
simple belief that God’s promise was meant and was substantial that made
him indifferent as to what Lot might choose. His faith was judged in
this scene, and was proved to be sound.... Wherever there is faith the
same results will appear. He who believes that God is pledged to provide
for him cannot be greedy, anxious, covetous; can only be liberal, even
magnanimous.—_The Expositor’s Bible_, _Genesis_, _Marcus Dods_.


AIM

=To lead the children to admire the kindliness and unselfishness of
Abram, and to exhibit a similar spirit in their own daily lives.=


LESSON PREPARATION

After you have read carefully the story of this lesson answer for
yourself these questions: What is the most important teaching point in
this story? How can I arrange the material of the story in such a way as
to bring that point into strongest perspective? Abram gave up to another
what he had a perfect right to take for himself. Would Junior children
generally regard that as a foolish thing to do, and, therefore, lose
all the force of the lesson if too much stress should be put upon that
phase of the truth? What is the Junior child’s highest conception of what
must be done in order to obey the Golden Rule? What elements in Lot’s
character stand out clearly in this transaction? How does he exhibit
indifference toward the best welfare of his family?

The consequences of his choice come out in later lessons, and are exactly
what might be expected, but, of course, these must not be touched upon in
this lesson. The only point which needs emphasis here is the statement of
verse 13.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

Abram was sitting in the door of his tent. Sarai, his wife, was near by
and was watching him anxiously, for she could see that he was troubled,
but she knew not why. They had just returned to the place near Bethel
from a long journey which they took into Egypt because there had been
a famine in the land of Canaan. Their flocks and herds were so many
that Abram was known as a very rich man in a country where men counted
their wealth by the number of cattle they owned. The dark tents of
Abram’s servants stretched away over the valley and up on the sides of
the low hills, for his followers were many. Lot, Abram’s nephew, also
had servants and flocks and herds. His tents were there too, and the
smoke was going up from many fires, for it was supper time. As Abram sat
looking out over the valley, Sarai questioned softly, “What is it that
troubles thee?” And Abram answered, “Thou knowest how I have thought that
Lot would always be with us, as he has been all his life; but I cannot
now see how that can be. To-day and yesterday, and indeed every day
since we pitched our tents in this valley, as I have gone about to see
how the herds and flocks were being cared for by the men, I have found
quarreling and strife among the herdsmen.” “Quarreling and strife?” “Yea,
thou knowest we have had none of that before, but now our cattle are so
many and there are so few good pasture lands that were not already in use
by the Canaanites and the Perrizzites before we came into the land, and
there are so few wells or springs of water beside those that they claim,
that there is constant strife between Lot’s herdsmen and ours. Each one
claims every spring of water and pasture land, and so they quarrel. We
cannot have this kind of thing. Brothers should live together in unity,
and I must find a way to end the strife. Of course my men feel in duty
bound to find water and pasture for my cattle; that is what they are told
to do; and Lot’s men must do the same for his, but we cannot have them
fighting about it.”


The Lesson Story

The next morning Abram asked Lot to take a walk with him, and as they
together climbed a hill near by, Abram told his nephew of the quarreling
among their men, and then he said something like this: “You see, we have
now so many cattle that no one part of the country can give us all the
pasture that we need. I had hoped that we might always live together,
but I see that we cannot do so and have peace and right feeling among
our servants.” Now, of course, you know that Abram might then have
said to his nephew, “God has promised all of this land to me and to my
children, so it is only right that I should first choose the part of
the land in which I wish to live, and that is what I intend to do now.”
But Abram knew a better way than that. Open your Bibles and read with
me Genesis 13:8, 9. So you see, Abram gave Lot the first choice, and
as they stood together on the summit of the hill they had climbed, Lot
could look to the north, west, and south and could see few pasture lands,
but many rugged mountains and rather barren valleys. But to the east he
saw the well-watered plain of the Jordan, where the grass grew rich and
green, and he said as he pointed that way, “I will take the plain of the
Jordan.” Very soon they separated, Lot and his family, with his servants
and cattle, going down into the Jordan valley, while Abram journeyed
south over the mountains until he came to Hebron.

What did Lot really choose? Not simply pasture lands for his flocks. He
chose selfishness and greed, for he took the best for himself when he
knew his uncle had the right to it. He chose wicked people to be his
neighbors and friends, for there were cities in the valley. Listen to
what the Bible says about the people in a city near which Lot pitched his
tents. (Read verses 12 and 13.)

But what of Abram? What did he choose? He chose unselfishness and
generosity, and he gained something better than fine pasture for his
cattle, for he knew that he had pleased his heavenly Father, and soon he
heard the voice of God speaking to him, and saying (read verses 14, 15,
18).

If possible, have the memory text written upon cards in attractive form,
with initial letter illuminated. Give one of these cards to each pupil,
and with it these statements and the question to be answered next Sunday:
This is a rule that Jesus gave to his disciples. It has been called the
Golden Rule. Can you think of any reason why it should have such a name
as that?


PUPIL’S BOOK FOR WORK AND STUDY

Show the children the picture for this lesson and explain that it is
taken from a photograph of the Jordan valley as it appears to-day, and
shows part of what Lot saw when he made his choice.




LESSON 10

THE CORRELATED LESSON


Refer to the question asked in connection with Friday’s reading, and call
for the written answers. Read them and let the children talk about them
freely. Then take up the question about the Golden Rule and get their
ideas concerning the name that has been given to it. Help them to see how
like heaven this world would be if everyone obeyed that rule. Tell them
that people also speak of an Iron Rule and a Silver Rule. Perhaps they
can guess what the Iron Rule would be. It is the rule of savage men. It
says, “If evil is done to you, do evil in return.” The Silver Rule is
the rule of worldly men. That says, “If good is done to you, do good in
return.” See if the children can tell why that rule is called “silver” in
comparison with the Iron Rule. Then comes the Golden Rule, best of all,
because it says nothing about what other people do, but tells each one
under all circumstances, everywhere, to do to others as he would like to
have them do to him.

If you have time review the texts with the colors as given to the
children last Sunday. Then tell them that the white ribbon is used for
the four Gospels which tell of the life of Jesus. Let them find Luke
among the first books of the New Testament and mark the Golden Rule, Luke
6:31 with a strip of white paper.

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

Archæology. In this chapter we again come in contact with Babylonian
records, not, as heretofore, with mythology, but with history. We may
regard it as certain that Chedorlaomer and his allies were actual
historical personages; that Elam at one period was the dominant power in
the lands east of the Euphrates, as implied in verses 5, 9, and 17; and
that in the same period the dominant power in those Eastern lands claimed
and sometimes exercised a certain supremacy in Palestine, which was
enforced occasionally by such warlike expeditions as the one described
here. It is also not improbable that the four Eastern kings mentioned
here were contemporaries, and that Elam was the dominant power in their
time.... Amraphel: usually identified with Hammurabi, a Babylonian king,
known to us from the inscriptions. Numerous letters and inscriptions
of Hammurabi have been discovered, including forty-six dispatches
(inscribed tablets of baked clay) to a high official or tributary
prince. “Hammurabi,” we are told, “is already known, from the date on a
Babylonian contract, to have succeeded in defeating the Elamites in the
course of his reign, and this fact would not be inconsistent with his
having been Chedorlaomer’s ally during the earlier part of his reign, to
which period the narrative in Genesis 14 would, on this assumption, be
referred.”—_New Century Bible_, _Genesis_, _W. H. Bennett, D.D._

No one fails to see what it was that balanced Abram in this intoxicating
march. No one asks what enabled him, while leading his armed followers
flushed with success through a land weakened by recent dismay and
disaster, to restrain them and himself from claiming the whole land
as his. No one asks what gave him moral perception to see that the
opportunity given him of winning the land by the sword was a temptation,
not a guiding providence. To every reader it is obvious that his
dependence on God was his safeguard and his light. God would bring him by
fair and honorable means to his own. There was no need of violence, no
need of receiving help from doubtful allies. This is true nobility; and
this, faith always produces.—_The Expositor’s Bible_, _Genesis_, _Marcus
Dods_.


AIM

=The aim in this lesson will be practically the same as that of Lesson 9.
This story shows again the kindliness and unselfishness of Abram and even
more forcibly and attractively perhaps for the Junior children, as those
qualities are exhibited in the doing of a brave and hazardous thing.=


LESSON PREPARATION

In the lesson story as given last week how much was taken directly from
the biblical narrative? How far do you think it legitimate to expand
the Bible story? Was the part not given in the Bible narrative true to
your conception of the times in which the story has its setting? Bible
stories sometimes need expansion to make them complete and interesting
to the children. It was not a necessity in last Sunday’s lesson, but
was chosen simply as a way of introducing the lesson story. In all our
story work it is not important that the story shall always be something
that has actually happened, but it must be something that, given certain
conditions, could and would be likely to happen. In expanding Bible
stories we must keep the facts not only true to life, but true to what we
know of the age to which they relate. There are many fictitious stories
that are true, that is, true to life and to the principles that underlie
all action. There are others that are both fictitious and false. Take,
for example, the so-called Sunday school stories of fifty years ago in
which the good boy was so abnormal and impossible that every normal boy
who read the book revolted from the type with a natural and healthy
hatred. All our illustrative stories must be true to life, and must
not present a moral so apparent as to cause the child to react from it
because of the sheer force of the impact.

The lesson for this week is intensely interesting both to us who are
older and to the children, but the points of deepest interest in each
case will be different. For us the mysterious Melchizedek, “who passes
over the stage a living king and priest,” and then is seen no more,
possesses much of charm and fascination. The difference between the Abram
who was enriched without protest in Egypt by a heathen king (Genesis
12:16), and the Abram who disdains to take so much as a shoe lace from
the king of Sodom (Genesis 14:23), is also of interest to us. But, of
course, in studying the lesson to present it to the children we must
put these things far in the background and get the story with its vivid
action and rapid movement so thoroughly into the mind and heart that it
can be told with as much feeling as would characterize the narration of
an event that happened yesterday.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

Down in the Jordan valley, close by the side of Sodom, there are many
dark tents. Cattle are feeding in the rich pasture lands and both the
tents and the cattle belong to Abram’s nephew, Lot. Up among the rugged
mountains, west of the Dead Sea, is Hebron, and there too we see many,
many tents, and in the door of the tent of the ruler, or chief, we see
Abram. There was a time when you would have seen the tents of Abram and
Lot very near together. Why are they now separated by so many miles?
Why did Abram let Lot choose first and take the best of the land? Why
did Lot take the Jordan Valley? (Let the review so far as possible come
spontaneously from the children, but if it lags in any degree, or if the
important points are not brought out, ask questions that will make the
story complete.)

The days passed very pleasantly in Abram’s camp. There was now no
quarreling among the herdsmen, but the camp was a busy place, for all had
work to do. Abram himself was not idle. Among his servants there were
more than three hundred men who were able to fight, and Abram needed
to have soldiers to protect the great company of people over whom he
was chief, and to protect the flocks from robbers if any should come to
steal. So Abram spent quite a good deal of his time training his men, so
that they would know how to obey and fight under a leader as all good
soldiers must.


The Lesson Story

One day there was much excitement in Abram’s usually quiet camp. A crowd
was gathered about a man from the plain who bore the stains of battle,
and was worn and hurt with the roughness of the way he had traveled.
Eagerly they questioned: “What has happened? How were you hurt? From what
city have you come?” and soon they heard the story. “Four kings from
Babylon, with their armies, came into the Jordan valley to fight against
the cities of the plain because they had rebelled the year before and
refused to pay tribute, as they had been doing. The five kings of the
cities with their fighting men went out to meet their enemies, but were
dreadfully beaten. Many were caught in the slime pits of the valley and
died there. Some escaped to the mountains, as I did; but our enemies
have taken the women and children and the goods and cattle of Sodom and
Gomorrah and have gone back in triumph to their own country.” Of course
you can guess the question that Abram and many others asked right away:
“What has happened to Lot? Was he killed in the battle?” “No,” was
the answer, “but he went out to help the king of Sodom and was taken
prisoner. His wife and children were taken, too, and all his cattle.”

What do you think Abram did when he heard this news? Instantly he
called for his three hundred and eighteen men whom he had trained to be
soldiers, and told them to get ready for the march. There were three
chieftains in that part of the country named Mamre, Eschol, and Aner,
with whom Abram was friendly, and when he sent word to them that he
was going to rescue his nephew and the other people taken by the kings
of the East, they joined him, and the party started north. They had to
travel more than a hundred miles before they overtook the enemy. Then
they waited until night, when Abram divided his company in such a way
as to make an attack at one time from different places. The soldiers
were sleeping, thinking themselves perfectly safe, and when the attack
came they were panic-stricken and fled, and Abram pursued them as far as
Hobah, a village near Damascus. Then he led his soldiers, his nephew Lot,
Lot’s family, and all the other people of Sodom and Gomorrah with their
possessions back toward home.

As Abram passed near Salem, in the mountains west of Sodom, Melchizedek,
who was both priest and king in that city, brought food and drink for
the soldiers and for the people who had been rescued, and he blessed
Abram saying, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and
earth: and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies
into thy hand.” And to him, as the priest of the most high God, Abram
gave a tenth of all that he had taken in the battle. Then the king of
Sodom came to meet Abram. It was considered the right thing for anyone
who gained a victory in battle to keep for himself all the goods that
he took and the people also for slaves, to keep or sell as he wished.
The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Let me have the people that you have
rescued, but keep the goods for yourself,” but Abram answered, “I have
vowed to the Most High God that I will not take so much as a thread or
a shoe lace of all these things, nor anything else that belongs to you,
because if I do, you may say that you made me rich. Let there be nothing
for me. Let all that is taken from your possessions be what my soldiers
have eaten and the portion that rightfully belongs to my allies, these
three men who went with me.”

It seems strange that in this story there is nothing to tell us that Lot
even thanked his uncle for what he had done. All that we know is that
he went back into the Jordan valley and to wicked Sodom, and Abram and
his soldiers and the friends who had helped him journeyed south until
they came to the home tents at Hebron. Did you ever hear the proverb,
“A friend in need is a friend indeed”? Open your Bibles in the middle,
turn to the next book on the right, and you will see that it is the book
of Proverbs. Find chapter 17 and verse 17, and let us read that proverb
together. Who was it in this story that acted the part of a friend? A
friend to whom? What is the name that Abram earned for himself? Do you
not think that a friend of God would always be quite sure to be a friend
of man also?

(Ask the children to watch during the coming week and see how many people
they can find who are doing kindly things for others. Suggest that they
try themselves to be “friends” and “brothers” to everybody who needs any
help that they can give.)




LESSON 11

THE CORRELATED LESSON


(If the children have the colored slips marking their memory verses
corresponding to the rainbow bookmark colors, as suggested in Lesson 8,
it will be easy for them to find the verses. Such a drill as the one
given here will not only fix the verses in their memory associated with
their meaning, but will help the children to acquire facility in handling
the Bible and turning quickly to references. As you will see this lesson
is partly a drill on information which is given on page 31 of the Pupil’s
Book for Work and Study.)

How many memory texts have we had in the first book of the Bible? What
is the name of that book? What is the color in the rainbow bookmark for
the first five books? What are those books called? Who can tell what the
memory texts in Genesis are without looking in the book? Who can give one
from Jeremiah?

Who will find for me a verse about love? What is that chapter called?
Then if any one should ask you, “Where will I find the Love Chapter in
the Bible?” what would you answer? Who will find a verse that tells how
Abraham obeyed when God called him? What is that chapter about? Then what
is it called? In what book is the Faith Chapter found? What is the number
of the chapter? Let us see if we can all find the Christmas Story.

What one of our memory verses would you like me to find? (Give out the
other memory verses by subjects and let each child read the verse he
has found.) What is the text that tells us what a friend and a brother
will do for any one who needs his help? Let us find that in the Bible.
Open your Bibles in the middle. What book have you there? That is the
hymn book of the Bible. The next book to the right is another book of
poetry, and that is the one which has our memory text in it. The chapter
and verse are both 17. Who will be the first to find it? Yellow is the
color for the books of poetry, so I will give you a yellow slip to mark
the place of this verse. Let us all read it together. Who can tell me in
other words what that verse means?

FROM THE COMMENTATORS

(Genesis 15:1-7.) Abram felt that he had made the mightiest earthly
powers his enemies, and probably feared that the next campaigning season
would bring down on his encampment an irresistible host; so the word of
encouragement comes, “Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield.” Besides, he saw
that he was exhibited to his followers as a man who had the enjoyment
neither of this world’s winnings nor of the promise of God, for the sake
of which he sacrificed the booty offered him by Sodom. The soreness he
felt on this account was removed by the assurance, “I am thy exceeding
great reward.”—_Commentary on Genesis_, _Marcus Dods_.


AIM

=To further deepen the impression made by the last two lessons, helping
the children to see the beauty of kindness, and so stimulate within them
the desire to practice kindness and helpfulness in their own lives.=


LESSON PREPARATION

These lessons give to us as teachers an opportunity for a leisurely study
of the book of Genesis of which every teacher should take advantage.
Of course all that intervenes between lessons at any point should be
read for one’s own information, but no more should be given to the
scholars than is indicated by the limits of the teaching material. It
is interesting to note in the study of chapter 17 that “the rite of
circumcision is not, as is sometimes thought, a rite peculiar to the
Jews. It was and still is widely practiced in different parts of the
world”; but while with other races the underlying principle seems to
be initiation into manhood, with full civil and religious rights, its
meaning among the Jews was and is the same as that which underlies our
sacrament of christening, namely, dedication to God.

The opportunity to lead children in the study of these early stories
is a privilege which every teacher should appreciate to the utmost.
Dr. Eiselen calls attention to the value of these stories in this way:
“Missionaries say—and experiences at home confirm the claim—that the
patriarchal narratives are of inestimable value to impress lessons of the
reality and providence of God, and to encourage the exercise of faith
and confidence in him. There is nothing that can be substituted for them
in religious instruction.”[4] He also quotes from Prof. W. W. White
twenty-one Christian virtues that are illustrated and enforced in the
life of Abraham: “He was steadfast, resolute, prudent, tactful, candid,
kind, self-controlled, obliging, self-denying, condescending, unselfish,
peaceable, hospitable, courteous, humble, thankful, reverent, prayerful,
worshipful, faithful, obedient.”

This lesson is a fitting climax to the three which show particularly
Abraham’s unselfishness and kindness and self-forgetful thoughtfulness.
In the other two he was acting for some one whom he knew and loved as a
father might love a son. In this incident he extends the most complete
and joyous hospitality to men whom he believed to be ordinary travelers.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

I wonder if Abram was not a little discouraged when he came back after
rescuing Lot and the other people of Sodom from the four kings of the
East? It would not be strange if he was both sad and discouraged, for
the nephew whom he loved had gone back among the wicked people of Sodom,
where his life was in danger all the time, and Abram might easily have
felt that he had not done very much for Lot, and had made enemies for
himself of the powerful kings whose soldiers he had attacked.


The Lesson Story

But if he was discouraged and half afraid, his heavenly Father and Friend
knew it, and he appeared to Abram in a vision saying, “Fear not, Abram:
I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” Then Abram said: “O
Lord, how will you give this land to my children as you have promised,
when I have no child at all?” The Lord took Abram out into the night and
bade him look at the stars in the sky, saying, “Can you count them? Your
children’s children shall be as many as the stars for number.” And Abram
believed God’s promise and was comforted. Again God appeared to him and
repeated his promise, and said, “Your name shall not be Abram any more
but Abraham, which means father of a multitude, and your wife’s name
shall no longer be Sarai but Sarah, or princess, for she shall be the
mother of kings.” Yet Abraham and Sarah had no children.

One noon time as Abraham stood in the tent door he saw three men coming
near. They were strangers to him, but he hastened to meet them and said,
“I pray you go no further in the heat of the day. Come and rest here
under the shade of the tree, and I will have water brought that your feet
may be bathed, and I will have something prepared for you to eat, and
after you are rested and refreshed you may go on your way.” The strangers
accepted the invitation, and Sarah and the servants soon had a dinner
prepared for the guests, and they ate while Abraham stood by to wait upon
them and show them every honor. It was not long before he found that his
guests were messengers from God. The promise that a child should come to
their home was given to Abraham again, but now one of the messengers told
Abraham just when Sarah’s son would be born. He said, “At this time next
year.” And Sarah heard what was said as she stood in the tent door near
by. Can you think how happy Abraham and Sarah must have been that day?
What a joy it was to them that they had provided the very best they had
for people who they thought were mere strangers. See what our memory text
says. (Hebrews 13:2.) Here is a command from that same chapter (verse
16). To “communicate” means to share the good things that you have with
others.

At the Christmas time when the birthday of Jesus is near, I am sure we
all wish that we could share the good things that we have with him. Have
you ever thought what you would have done if you had been in Bethlehem
the night Jesus was born? This is what some one has said:

  If I had been a sleeping guest
  Lodged at the inn that Christmas night,
  When the wee Lord was laid to rest
  In the cold stall in humble plight,
  I know I would have waked, instead,
  And given him my warm, soft bed.

How glad any of us would be to do that. Is there anything we can do? This
is what the rest of the poem says:

  But I was not a lodger there—
  It was so long ago, indeed.
  Yet all around me, everywhere,
  Are little children still in need,
  And when I love and cherish them
  I serve the Babe of Bethlehem.

LESSON 12

THE CORRELATED LESSON


Take your Bibles and see how many verses you can find among your memory
texts which tell us something that Abraham did, or some command that
makes us think of something he did because he obeyed it so well. (Hebrews
11:8a, c; Luke 6:31; Proverbs 17:17; Hebrews 13:2.) Would you say that
Abraham was loving? Might we think of Abraham then, when we read 1
Corinthians 13:4a? What is that whole chapter called in which it is said:
“And Abram when he was called obeyed, and he went out not knowing whither
he went”? In what book is the Faith Chapter? What is the number of the
chapter? In what book is the Love Chapter found? What chapter? How did it
happen that Abraham had angels for his guests one day? What command is

LESSON 12.—CHRISTMAS LESSON

The Song of Mary


=Teaching Material.=—Luke 1:21, 22, 26-55.

=Pupil’s Reading.=-Luke 1:26-28, 46-55.

=Memory Text.=—And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my
spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. Luke 1:46, 47.


LIGHT FROM OTHER BIBLE PASSAGES

Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:1-25.


FROM THE COMMENTATORS

This chapter is remarkable for preserving a record of two inspired
hymns—the Magnificat and the Benedictus—which have been used for more
than a thousand years in the public services of Christendom. The
Magnificat first appears in the office of Lauds in the rule of Saint
Cæsarius of Arles, A. D. 507. (Blunt, Annotated Prayer Book, p. 33.) It
is so full of Hebraisms as almost to form a mosaic of quotations from
the Old Testament, and it is closely analogous to the Song of Hannah
(1 Samuel 2:1-10). It may also be compared with the Hymn of Judith
(Judith 16:1-17). But it is animated by a new and more exalted spirit,
and is specially precious as forming a link of continuity between the
eucharistic poetry of the old and new dispensation.—_Cambridge Bible_,
Edited by _F. W. Farrar, D.D._


AIM

=To show that the coming of Jesus was the fulfillment of God’s promise to
Abraham; to arouse and deepen faith in God and gratitude for his greatest
Gift.=


LESSON PREPARATION

Read all of the first chapter of Luke and all of the references from
the chapter to other parts of the Bible. Picture to yourself the dark
and weary centuries of waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. If
possible, read some such book as Deborah, by Dr. James M. Ludlow, which
gives a vivid picture of the times of the Maccabees. The books of the
Maccabees in the Apocrypha and the article on Maccabees in any good
Bible dictionary will also be helpful in showing something of what the
God-fearing Jews had been suffering in the two hundred years preceding
the birth of Christ.


LESSON PRESENTATION


Introduction

I have a story of a song to tell you to-day. It was a song of praise
and gladness, but the joy that was in it was so great that there are no
words that could possibly tell it all. It was sung at first by just one
voice, but in the hundreds of years since it has been sung and spoken by
thousands upon thousands who have been made glad by the joy that rings
through it. It is sung in churches by choirs and people, and the words of
the song are read over and over again, especially at the Christmas time,
in every place where people have heard the Gospel message. Shall I tell
you how this song came to be sung the first time?

God had given this great promise to Abraham, “In thee shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed,” and as the years and years went by
the people who called Abraham their father became very many, and as the
fathers and mothers sat in the doors of their tents while the stars
were coming out they would say to their children, “Do you see how many
stars there are? God once told Abraham, our father, that his children’s
children should be as many as the stars, and that promise has come true.
But there was another and more wonderful promise than that, for God said,
‘In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,’ and that promise
will come true some day.” The children never forgot about that promise,
and they told it to their children, giving it as one would some precious
jewel, and they would always say, “The promise has not come true yet, but
it will.”

So the long years went by. Many of the people forgot God, and sorrow upon
sorrow came, and still there was no sign of the blessing that had been
promised. God sent to his people many prophets who spoke words of cheer,
and told of a Saviour who would come, but all the people knew was that
some day he would come, and they cried eagerly to the Lord saying, “How
long, O Lord, how long shall it be?” The hearts of the people grew sick
with waiting as they asked each other, “When will the promise come true?
When will the Saviour come?” But no one could answer, for none knew.

One day, in Jerusalem, those who truly loved the Lord came out of the
temple with joy shining in their faces. “Something has happened!” they
said to their friends, “We do not know just what it is, but Zacharias
the priest has seen a vision. He was in the temple burning incense, and
when he came out to us he could not speak, but he made us know that God
had sent him some wonderful message.” So the people began to hope that
this might mean the coming of the Saviour. But half a year went by and
there was still no sign of the coming of the promised One. Every priest
who went into the temple to offer incense must have hoped that some
message would come to him, but no vision of an angel was seen there again.


The Lesson Story

Up in the north in a city called Nazareth there lived a young woman, so
kind and good and true that even the birds and flowers seemed to love
her. As God looked at her and read the very thoughts and desires of her
heart, he knew that he could trust her with the care of the greatest
Gift he had ever sent to the earth, the One in whom the promise made to
Abraham should come true. So it happened one day that as Mary stood among
her flowers a messenger came and spoke to her saying, “Hail, thou that
art highly favored, the Lord is with thee.” Mary was troubled when she
heard his words, for she did not know what they meant. But with joy she
heard: “Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God, and to thee
shall be sent a Son in whom the promise made to Abraham shall come true,
for he shall bring blessing to all the people of the world. He will come
as a little baby, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save
his people from their sins. He shall be great, and shall be called the
Son of the Most High, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.”

When Mary heard this she could hardly believe that it was not all a
dream. To think that she should be chosen as the one through whom God’s
greatest promise should come true! All the people thought that the
Saviour would come as a great king, but Mary knew now that he was coming
to her arms as a little child, and there was great joy in her heart when
the angel left her and went back to the heavenly places. Very soon she
went to see her cousin Elisabeth, that she might tell her of the great
happiness that had come into her life, but Elisabeth already knew it, for
God had told her, and together they rejoiced that the great promise was
so soon to come true. Elisabeth told her gladness in a few words, but
Mary’s heart was so full that her praises flowed out in song (read verses
46-48, 54, 55).

So you see it was the promise to Abraham coming true; and you know how
one night at Bethlehem, while shepherds were watching their flocks on
the hillside, a Baby was born in the stable of an inn and was laid in a
manger for a cradle. That was the gladdest day of all the days that ever
have been or ever will be in this world, for it was the day when Jesus
was born in Bethlehem of Judæa. No wonder the angels sang, “Glory to God
in the highest.” No wonder we always wish to sing songs of joy at the
glad Christmas tide.

Let us say together the words of praise that Mary said: “My soul doth
magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.” And let
us praise God as the angels praised him the night when Jesus was born:
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men in whom he is
well pleased.” Is there any other way in which we can show our love and
gratitude? (Speak of what your Sunday school is doing for the poor, and
of the part which the Juniors have had in the gifts. Quote Matthew 25:40,
and call attention to pages 36 and 37 of the Pupil’s Book for Work and
Study.)




LESSON 13

THE CORRELATED LESSON


As the lesson for Christmas Sunday is not an integral part of the lessons
to be reviewed to-day, it would be well to have a conversation with the
children about the beautiful picture for the Christmas Lesson. Get them
to express themselves freely concerning it. Ask to what they think Mary
is listening, and in that way get from them the story of the angel’s
message. It is an interesting fact for teachers to know that while one of
the greatest charms of the picture as we have it is that it leaves the
angel to the imagination and centers all thought and attention upon Mary,
this effect is secured by leaving out half of the original painting in
the reproduction. In the painting the garden is shown extending to the
left and rear, and the angel is standing under the trees at some distance
from Mary. It is evidently the consensus of opinion that the presence
of the angel weakens the picture artistically, as it certainly does in
teaching power, for most of the reproductions leave out that feature of
the original. After the picture has been fully discussed and the story
given by the children, have the memory text recited and ask how many read
the Christmas story from the Bible. Give to each child a white strip to
mark the place of the Christmas Story and another for the Song of Mary.
See how many know the reference for the Christmas Story and drill upon it.




LESSON 13

Review


=Teacher’s Theme.=—Walking with God. Genesis 6:9; Proverbs 3:5, 6. See
also Genesis 5:21-24; Isaiah 30:21; Amos 3:3; Hebrews 11:5; 1 John 1:6,
7; 2:6; Revelation 3:4, 5.


LESSON PREPARATION

Read over at one sitting, if possible, Genesis chapters 6-18, with the
theme of this lesson uppermost in the mind. The story of Enoch has been
used for the pupil’s book because it fits in so well with this theme, and
because it is a name and a story that all children should know. It need
not be introduced into this review, of course, but the reference is given
as part of the study because Enoch is such a notable example of those who
walked with God.


LESSON PRESENTATION

(Draw on a large sheet of paper a road with another branching off from
it. Begin your lesson by telling of two persons starting out to walk
together.) When they come to the parting of the roads one says, “I am
going this way.” The other says, “I cannot go that way, for this is the
only road that leads to the place to which I wish to go.” What must they
do if they are to keep on walking together? Two cannot walk together
unless they agree and are willing to go the same road. If one of the two
must take this road and the other can take whichever he chooses, it is
quite certain that the one who can choose will go with his friend if he
really loves him and wishes to be with him.

Do you remember what the Bible says about Noah? Noah walked with—whom?
Let us see what that means. What is the road that God walks? It is
the way that leads to heaven. It is the way of love, goodness, joy,
kindliness, obedience, trust, patience. Noah walked that way, but the
other people were filled with violence and their thoughts were evil.
There are no such things as violence and evil in the way that God walks,
so people who love those things are not walking with God. What do you
think of Abraham—did he walk with God? Why do you think so? (Get from the
children the story of his obedience to God’s call and the memory text
for that lesson; his giving Lot the first choice and the Golden Rule;
his unselfish risking of his life to rescue Lot, showing that he was
a true friend and brother, and his kindness in entertaining those who
he thought were strangers. Call for the memory texts for both of these
lessons by subjects and read or recite to the children Hebrews 13:16.)
How splendidly Abraham did these things! What name did he earn by his
obedience and love?

What story have we had about a woman who walked with God? Does any one
walk with God in these days? Can boys and girls as well as men and women
walk with God? Certainly, anyone who loves the Lord may walk with him,
and he loves us so much that it grieves him when we choose to go the
other way. In his Word we are told, “In all thy ways acknowledge him, and
he will direct thy paths.” Have you ever heard what seemed almost like a
voice inside of you saying, “That is wrong, do not do it”? That is the
voice of God speaking to you, for he has said, “Thine ears shall hear a
word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to
the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.” So that the voice that you
hear, which we call conscience, is God’s voice trying to keep you from
turning away from him and walking in evil ways. What does our text for
this year say? (Luke 11:28.) Is it easy to keep the word of God, to walk
his way? No, it is not easy but he has promised to help us and he will do
so always if we ask him. Do you talk to your heavenly Father every day?

(Ask how many use the prayer, “Now I lay me down to sleep,” and how many
offer some other prayer, not committed to memory, but their own? Ask
how many pray in the morning, and show them how much they need care and
guidance through the day, and ask them each morning to use this prayer:
“O, Lord, help me to walk with thee to-day in loving obedience.” When
children have reached the age of nine they should be led to see that
the mere recitation of a memorized verse is not talking with God. Many
parents teach the child some simple prayer when he is about four years
old, and give no further help nor instruction on the subject of prayer
from that time on; and for this reason a heavy responsibility rests
upon the Sunday school teacher. It is essential that the child shall
understand that talking with God is as real as talking with anyone whom
he can see; that God hears and answers always, but does not always answer
yes; that we need always to pray for help to do right and for forgiveness
when we do wrong; that we should talk with our loving heavenly Father
about everything that interests us. This note is put here because it is
important that teaching on prayer and suggestions concerning it should
be put in all through this course at any time when it comes in naturally
with the lesson.)

OPTIONAL

  Once in royal David’s city
    Stood a lowly cattle shed,
  Where a mother laid her Baby
    In a manger for his bed.
  Mary was that mother mild,
  Jesus Christ her little Child.

  And, thro’ all his wondrous childhood,
    He would honor, and obey,
  Love, and watch the lowly maiden
    In whose gentle arms he lay.
  Christian children all must be
  Mild, obedient, good as he.

  And our eyes at last shall see him,
    Thro’ his own redeeming love;
  For that Child so dear and gentle
    Is our Lord in heaven above,
  And he leads his children on
  To the place where he is gone.

O Lord, help me to walk with thee to-day in loving obedience. Amen.




APPENDIX B

BOOK LIST


THE EXPOSITOR’S BIBLE. Rev. W. R. Nicoll, editor.

THE NEW CENTURY BIBLE. W. H. Bennett, editor.

  These are both commentaries, though the first, as the name
  implies, gives an exposition of the truth rather than an
  explanation of the text. The New Century is a small volume. The
  Expositor’s Bible is larger. For these lessons one would need the
  volume on Genesis.

THE ONE VOLUME COMMENTARY. Rev. J. R. Dummelow, editor.

  This is a most remarkable one-volume commentary containing 1,092
  pages, and any teacher who cannot gain access to one having a
  volume for each book should by all means get this one if possible.

OLD TESTAMENT CHARACTERS. Cunningham Geikie.

  These are well written character studies and will be a help in
  getting in mind a rounded picture of the various characters.

A DICTIONARY OF THE BIBLE. One Volume. James Hastings, editor.

  A Dictionary of the Bible is well nigh indispensable for a Sunday
  school teacher, and this is as complete as one could be made
  within the limits of a single volume.

HISTORY FOR GRADED AND DISTRICT SCHOOLS. Ellwood W. Kemp.

  Besides the chapter referred to in Lesson 8 the one on “How the
  World Came to have Books” and many other stories would be helpful
  to a Sunday school teacher.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION. Herman H. Horne.

  The section on Religious Education, pages 333 to 527, is worth
  the price of the book.

TALKS ON PSYCHOLOGY AND LIFE’S IDEALS. William James.

  The chapters on Laws of Habit, Association of Ideas, Interest,
  Attention, Memory and the Will are specially valuable.

STORIES AND STORY TELLING. Edward P. St. John.

  The best Sunday school teachers in the Junior and younger grades
  are those who know how to tell stories well. This little book
  will be a great help if carefully studied, and its precepts
  practiced.

THE UNFOLDING LIFE. Antoinette A. Lamoreaux.

  It is impossible to teach effectively unless one knows his
  pupils. This book will be an aid to the teacher not only as it
  outlines the characteristics of the period, but as it presents
  the attitude which every teacher should have toward his work.

A CHART OF CHILDHOOD. E. P. St. John.

  In this chart the main characteristics of the different periods
  are concisely stated and carefully grouped.

THE PUPIL AND THE TEACHER. Luther A. Weigle.

  This book should be owned and read by every Sunday school
  teacher. It is not a large volume, but there is a great deal of
  information in it. The teacher who studies it cannot fail to
  understand his pupils better and teach them more effectively than
  he otherwise would.

TELLING BIBLE STORIES. Louise Seymour Houghton.

  This book is written primarily for mothers, but is of equal value
  to teachers. It is written “in the light of to-day’s science
  and exegesis,” and shows how the children may be helped to get
  the great truths of the Old Testament Stories without learning
  anything which must later be unlearned.


BOOKS FOR JUNIORS TO READ

  Sunday-school teachers are often asked by parents to suggest
  gift books for the children at Christmas time. The following are
  all books that Juniors will find pleasure in reading, and will
  delight to own:

THE OTHER WISE MAN. Henry van Dyke.

THE FIRST CHRISTMAS TREE. Henry van Dyke.

THIS WAY TO CHRISTMAS. Ruth Sawyer.

JOEL, A BOY OF GALILEE. A. F. Johnson.




APPENDIX C

LIST OF STEREOGRAPHS


LESSONS 1 TO 7. No Stereographs.


LESSON 8

“FOUR THOUSAND YEARS UNCHANGED; PATRIARCHAL LIFE IN PALESTINE TO-DAY”

This big, grassy plain is in a part of Galilee which Abraham and his
emigrant party probably crossed when they were moving into Palestine.
These people whom we see now are Bedouins. They live in almost the same
way as Abraham’s family, moving from one place to another, wherever they
can find plenty of pasturage for their animals. The Bible tells (Genesis
12:16) how Abraham owned camels like these. Abraham’s wife, Sarah, used
to spin coarse yarn out of the wool of her sheep and the hair of her
goats, and then weave the yarn into cloth for clothing and tents. These
tents before us were made in that way by Bedouin women. In the nearest
tent we can plainly see a piece of striped cloth hung up so as to divide
the tent into two rooms. Abraham’s camp home was like that, and one of
the two rooms was specially for Sarah. The clothes of these Bedouins are
much like the ones that Abraham and his men wore. Notice how each Bedouin
has, instead of a hat, a large piece of cloth to protect the top of his
head and the back of his neck from the hot sun.


LESSON 9

“HEBRON, THE HOME OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB”

This town whose little stone houses are crowded so close together is the
place which the Bible calls Hebron. It was an old town even when Abraham
first came here. Abraham settled down near the village, and his cattle,
sheep, and goats were pastured on hills like those we see beyond the
town. We can read in our Bibles all about how Abraham bought a certain
part of this very land that we see now, and how he paid for it in silver
(Genesis 23:3-20). Look in the part of Hebron which is farthest toward
your right hand, and you will see a tall stone tower. The field that
Abraham bought of Ephron is around where that tower now stands. Part of
it has been built upon since Abraham’s time. The trees between us and the
town are olive trees.


LESSON 10

“THE JORDAN’S MAIN SOURCE, AT DAN”

This is up among the hills in the northern part of Palestine. A high
and beautiful mountain stands close by, though we cannot see it in the
picture; those trees are in the way. Over beyond the trees there is a
great spring, where clear, cold water comes pouring out of an opening in
the earth at the foot of the mountain. These bubbling, splashing waters
are hurrying away from the spring to make room for more that rush out to
take their place. When Abraham and his men chased the robber chiefs to
rescue Lot and save Lot’s property, they came away up here. They found
the camp of the robbers on a hill beside this stream, and attacked the
enemies in the night. Here they set Lot free, and here they recovered
the stolen goods—probably things like silver and jewels, woven cloth and
leather bags full of olive oil. All such things were very valuable. Here
they packed the property in bundles, ready to be carried home again on
the backs of camels and donkeys.


LESSON 11

“ANCIENT TREE, TRADITIONALLY KNOWN AS ABRAHAM’S OAK, NEAR HEBRON”

This is a very old tree. It is a kind of oak different from those that
grow in America. There used to be groves of such trees in Palestine long
ago, but now they are very rare. It was near a big tree of this sort that
Abraham pitched his tent when he first settled down to live near Hebron.
The Bible story (Genesis 18:1-8) tells how three visitors once came to
see him, and how he asked them to rest “under the tree” while Sarah
got dinner ready. And the Bible tells also (Genesis 15:5) how God one
night called Abraham to look up into the sky and see the countless stars
sparkling and twinkling there. It may have been near this very tree that
Abraham looked up that night.


LESSON 12

“CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY AT BETHLEHEM, BUILT WHERE JESUS WAS BORN”

This open space where the men are standing and talking is Bethlehem’s
market square. For hundreds and hundreds of years men who have had barley
or wheat, sheep or donkeys or cloth or firewood to sell have brought them
here to find customers. It was so at the time when Joseph and Mary came
to Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. That big stone building at the farther end
of the square (it is really a church, though it does not look much like
our churches) had not then been built. The ground where it stands was
then a “khan” or camping-place, with a wall around it, where strangers
could rest over night and feed their tired camels. When Joseph and Mary
reached this khan (which our Bibles call an “inn”) it was so full of
travelers that they could not find a good, comfortable place, but had to
stay in a part of it which was meant only for animals. The place where
the Child Jesus was first laid to sleep is now under that stone church.
People from all parts of the world make journeys to Bethlehem, on purpose
to pray here where our Lord was born.




APPENDIX D

AIDS FOR SUPERINTENDENT AND TEACHER


Junior Worker and Work

This book is of value to both superintendents and teachers. In it
there are seven chapters that deal with various phases in the life of
the junior child, at home, at school, at play, in the Sunday school
and church. There are nine chapters that are concerned more or less
directly with the teacher’s work in the school and between Sundays,
such as: A Graded Course of Study, Correlated Lessons, Methods of
Teaching, Story Telling, the Value of Handwork and Connecting Truth with
Life. The superintendent will find help for problems of management,
grading, organization, equipment, the department service of worship, the
celebration of special days and in guiding the play life of the pupils.


Rainbow Bookmark

One of the first and most difficult of the tasks that a junior must
perform is learning the names of the books of the Bible and its
divisions. The bookmark, which has a ribbon for each division, is a help
to the child, and it is of special value to the superintendent in varying
the department drills and making them attractive.


Junior Badge

The open book, which is the form of the badge, suggests the Bible,
and the words “Hear” and “Do” bring to mind the junior motto, “Be ye
doers of the Word and not hearers only.” The badge is silver enameled
in the junior colors, blue and white. It is mentioned as an aid to
superintendent and teacher because it has proved to be so great a help to
the child in his character building. It appeals to his love of insignia;
it enables him to show his colors without phariseeism, and is a silent
monitor of great value in times of temptation.


Record of Credits

The average junior child must be stimulated by incentives if he is to
form and fix in his life those habits which lie at the foundation of
Christian character. Commendation for work well done is the highest type
of reward, and to this reward every child who does good work is entitled.
In order to be perfectly certain that credit is given where credit is
due, an accurate record is necessary, and with this loose leaf record
plan it is easy to keep accurately the credits of each pupil as well as
of the class as a whole. Each leaf furnishes space for the pupil’s record
for a year. Every class should have one leaf for each member and one for
the record of the credits earned by the class. The leaves are so dated
that the year’s work begins the first of October.


Honor Roll

In order that the boys and girls who are entitled to honor shall receive
public recognition, a wall roll upon which the names may be posted
every month is most desirable. It is possible to write the names on
a blackboard or on a sheet of bristol board and so bring them into
notice, but it is much better to add to the beauty of the room and at
the same time make the honor seem more worthwhile by having the names
inscribed in a framed Honor Roll, with the name and design attractively
lettered and colored. In the best of these rolls the mat carries the
name and decoration and this is fastened to the frame while the back is
detachable, and there are many extra sheets provided so that a new one
may be inserted whenever it is necessary to change the roll.


Promotion Certificates

The last day in September is always a promotion day for each pupil in
every thoroughly graded school. In some cases the promotion is from one
grade to another within a department, but it is quite as important that
the fact of such progression should be noted as it is to give a diploma
to the child who completes the junior course. A different card has been
prepared for each year, with place for noting whatever honors have been
earned in addition to the required work.


Diplomas

It is difficult for adults to realize how much a diploma given by the
Sunday school is valued by the child who has earned it. The pupil who
is honorably promoted from any one department of the school to the next
should be given a diploma duly inscribed, rolled and tied with the
junior colors, and publicly presented by the pastor of the church or the
superintendent of the Sunday school. It is quite essential, where honors
are given for extra memory or handwork, that these should be noted on the
diploma. On some of the recent diplomas certain honors are designated
giving an opportunity to star those that have been won by each pupil.


Temperance Pledge Wall Roll

Every Junior Department should have a wall roll upon which to place the
names of the children who sign the temperance pledge. A wall pledge
reproducing the wording of the Declaration of Independence pledge can be
purchased from the National Temperance Society and Publication House in
New York City. The Methodist Book Concern issues a pledge roll which has
the name in a colored design and the portraits of Frances Willard and
John B. Gough at the sides.


Birthday Cards

There are few ways in which the junior superintendent and teacher can
create so close a personal tie with the pupils as by noticing birthdays
either by letters or birthday cards. Beautiful birthday cards have been
prepared for the four junior years. In the first year there is but one
card intended for both boys and girls. These cards were designed and
drawn by well-known artists, and are printed in attractive colors. The
sentiments are such as will appeal to the junior children.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
